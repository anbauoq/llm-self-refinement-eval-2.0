{"id":1,"question":"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?\n# Answer option: ['A)$61', 'B)$65', 'C)$67.40', 'D)$70', 'E)$78.20']","chain_of_thought":"Let x be the original price of the item. The discount is 0.22x, and the discounted price is 0.78x. The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so the price paid is (0.78x + 1.90) / 2.  The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so (0.78x + 1.90) / 2 = 0.78x. This simplifies to 0.78x + 1.90 = 1.56x. Solving for x, we get 1.90 = 0.78x, so x = 1.90 / 0.78 = 2.47.
