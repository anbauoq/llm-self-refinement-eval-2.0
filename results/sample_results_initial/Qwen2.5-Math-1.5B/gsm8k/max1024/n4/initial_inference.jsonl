{"id":3,"question":"Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?","chain_of_thought":"\\boxed{125000}\nTo solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the new value of the house after repairs.\n2. Calculate the profit made by subtracting the total cost (original cost + repairs) from the new value of the house.\n\nLet's break it down:\n\n1. The original cost of the house is $80,000.\n2. The repairs cost $50,000.\n3. The new value of the house after repairs is the original cost plus the repairs cost, which is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.\n4. The value of the house increased by 150%, so the new value is the original value plus 150% of the original value. This can be calculated as $130,000 = $80,000 + 1.5 * $80,000 = $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. However, since the problem states that the value increased by 150%, we can directly use the value of $130,000 as the new value.\n5. The profit made is the new value of the house minus the total cost (original cost + repairs), which is $130,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $130,000 - $130,000 = $0.\n\nHowever, since the problem states that the value increased by 150%, we need to use the new value of $200,000 to calculate the profit.
