{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n# Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","chain_of_thought":"The car is moving at a constant speed, so the time it takes to travel a certain distance is proportional to the distance. The change in the angle of elevation from 45° to 60° indicates that the car has traveled a certain distance towards the base of the tower. The tangent of the angle of elevation gives the ratio of the height of the tower to the distance from the car to the base of the tower. At 45°, the tangent is 1, meaning the height of the tower is equal to the distance from the car to the base. At 60°, the tangent is √3, meaning the height of the tower is √3 times the distance from the car to the base. The car has traveled a distance equal to the height of the tower, which is the same as the distance from the car to the base when the angle is 45°. Since it takes 10 minutes to travel this distance, and the car is moving at a constant speed, it will take another 10 minutes to reach the base of the tower, making the total time 20 minutes. However, the question asks for the additional time needed after the angle has changed to 60°. Since it took 10 minutes to change the angle from 45° to 60°, the additional time to reach the base of the tower is 10 minutes. The correct answer is not listed among the options, so the answer is E) None of these.\n\nThe answer is: \\boxed{E}","full_output":"The car is moving at a constant speed, so the time it takes to travel a certain distance is proportional to the distance.
