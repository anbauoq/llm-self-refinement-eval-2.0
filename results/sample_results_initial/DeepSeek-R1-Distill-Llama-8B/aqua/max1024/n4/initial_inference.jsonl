{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n# Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the problem is about a car moving towards the base of a vertical tower, observed from the car, and the angle of elevation changes from 45 degrees to 60 degrees in 10 minutes. We need to find out how much more time the car will take to reach the base after the angle changes from 45° to 60°.\n\nFirst, I remember that when you're dealing with angles of elevation, the relationship between the angle and the distance can be modeled using trigonometric functions. Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, the distance covered is directly proportional to the time taken.\n\nLet me visualize this. The car is moving along a straight line towards the base of the tower. At two different points in time, the angle of elevation to the top of the tower is 45° and then 60°. The angle changes because the car is getting closer to the tower.\n\nLet’s denote the height of the tower as h. The horizontal distance from the current position of the car to the base of the tower when the angle is 45° is let's say x. Similarly, when the angle is 60°, the horizontal distance will be y. The vertical side of the triangle (height of the tower) is h in both cases, so we can write the equations using the tangent function.\n\nFor the first angle (45°):\ntan(45°) = h / x → h = x * tan(45°). Since tan(45°) is 1, so h = x.\n\nFor the second angle (60°):\ntan(60°) = h / y → h = y * tan(60°). We know tan(60°) is √3, so h = y * √3.\n\nSince the height of the tower is the same in both cases, we can set these equal:\nx = y * √3 → y = x / √3.\n\nNow, the car has moved from position x to y, so the distance covered in that 10 minutes is (x - y) = x - (x / √3) = x (1 - 1/√3) = x (√3 - 1)/√3.\n\nSince the car is moving at a uniform speed, the time taken to cover a distance is distance divided by speed. Let’s denote the speed as v. The time taken to go from x to y is 10 minutes, so:\n\n10 = (x (√3 - 1)/√3) / v → v = (x (√3 - 1))/(10√3).\n\nNow, after the angle changes from 60° to 90°, the car will be at the base of the tower. At 60°, the horizontal distance is y = x / √3. The remaining distance to the base is y. So, the time taken to cover this distance at speed v is:\n\nTime = distance / speed = y / v.\n\nSubstituting v from earlier:\nTime = (x / √3) / (x (√3 - 1)/(10√3)) ) = (1/√3) * (10√3) / (√3 - 1) = 10 / (√3 - 1).\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (√3 + 1):\n\n10 (√3 + 1) / [ (√3)^2 - (1)^2 ] = 10(√3 + 1) / (3 - 1) = 10(√3 + 1)/2 = 5(√3 + 1).\n\nBut wait, this is the time from the moment the angle becomes 60°. The total time taken from the start would be 10 minutes (time from 45° to 60°) plus this 5(√3 + 1) minutes. So the total time is 10 + 5(√3 + 1) = 5(2 + √3 + 1) = 5(3 + √3). But the question asks how much more time after the angle changes to 60°, so it's 5(√3 + 1) minutes.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is 5(√3 + 1), so the answer should be option A.","full_output":"Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step.

So, the original price of an item is discounted by 22%, and then the customer uses a $20-off coupon. After these two discounts, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price.

So, the discounted price would be the original price minus 22% of P. Alternatively, the discounted price is 78% of P because 100% - 22% = 78%.

That sounds like the probability of both events not happening.

But wait, are these events independent? The question doesn't specify any relationship between the two stocks, so I guess we can assume they're independent.\n\nSo, for Stock A, the probability of it not increasing is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. For Stock B, the probability of it not increasing is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. If these events are independent, the probability that neither happens is 0.44 * 0.26.
