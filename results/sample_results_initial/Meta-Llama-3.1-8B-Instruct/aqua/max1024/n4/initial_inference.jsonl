{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n# Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","full_output":"Let's start with the basics: the car is moving in a straight line towards the tower, so we can consider it as a right-angled triangle problem. Let the distance between the car and the tower be x and the height of the tower be h. The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°. Using the tangent function for right-angled triangles, we can set up two equations: tan(45°) = h/x and tan(60°) = h/(x + d), where d is the distance the car travels in the given time. From the first equation, we know h = x. From the second equation, we have h = (x + d)tan(60°) = x + d√3. Now we have x = x + d√3, which implies d√3 = 0. So d = 0. But we know that the car is moving, so d cannot be 0. This is an inconsistency in the question, so the correct answer is E.","chain_of_thought":"Let's start with the basics: the car is moving in a straight line towards the tower, so we can consider it as a right-angled triangle problem.

{"id":1,"question":"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon.

If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?\n# Answer option: ['A)$61', 'B)$65', 'C)$67.40', 'D)$70', 'E)$78.20']","chain_of_thought":"Let x be the original price of the item. The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is 0.78x (1 − 0.22 = 0.78). The customer then uses a $20-off coupon, so they pay 0.78x − 20. We are told this is $1.90 more than half the original price, so 0.78x − 20 = 0.5x + 1.90. Subtract 0.5x from both sides to get 0.28x − 20 = 1.90. Add 20 to both sides to get 0.28x = 21.90.

We need to find the probability that neither of these events will occur, which is the probability that both events will occur in their complement, i.e., the probability that neither stock will increase in value. This can be represented as P(A' ∩ B') = 1 - P(A ∪ B). Since P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B), we need to find P(A ∩ B). Since the two events are independent, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.56 * 0.74 = 0.4136. Now, P(A ∪ B) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.4136 = 0.8064. Therefore, P(A' ∩ B') = 1 - 0.8064 = 0.1936.
