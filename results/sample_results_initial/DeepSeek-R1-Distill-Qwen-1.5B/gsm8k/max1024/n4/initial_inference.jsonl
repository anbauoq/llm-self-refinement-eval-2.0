{"id":1,"question":"Janet’s ducks lay 16 eggs per day. She eats three for breakfast every morning and bakes muffins for her friends every day with four. She sells the remainder at the farmers' market daily for $2 per fresh duck egg. How much in dollars does she make every day at the farmers' market?","chain_of_thought":"Alright, let's figure out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market every day. She has ducks laying eggs, eating some for breakfast, baking muffins, and selling the rest. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Janet's ducks lay a total of 16 eggs per day. That's the starting point.\n\nNext, she eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning. So, I'll subtract those 3 eggs from the total daily eggs. That gives me 16 - 3 = 13 eggs remaining after breakfast.\n\nThen, she uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends. I'll subtract those 4 eggs from the remaining 13. So, 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left after baking muffins.\n\nNow, she sells the remaining eggs at the farmers' market, and each egg is sold for $2. To find out how much money she makes each day, I'll multiply the number of eggs she sells by the price per egg. That's 9 × $2 = $18.\n\nSo, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.","full_output":"Alright, let's figure out how much Janet makes at the farmers' market every day.

{"id":2,"question":"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let's see. The question is about figuring out how many bolts of fiber are needed for a robe. It says the robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber. Hmm, so first, I need to understand what \"half that much\" means in terms of the number of bolts.\n\nIf the blue fiber is 2 bolts, then the white fiber is half of that. So half of 2 is... let me calculate that. Half of 2 is 1, right? So white fiber is 1 bolt. Now, to find the total number of bolts needed, I just add the blue and white fibers together. That would be 2 bolts of blue plus 1 bolt of white. \n\nSo, 2 plus 1 equals 3. Therefore, the total number of bolts needed for the robe is 3.","full_output":"Okay, let's see.
