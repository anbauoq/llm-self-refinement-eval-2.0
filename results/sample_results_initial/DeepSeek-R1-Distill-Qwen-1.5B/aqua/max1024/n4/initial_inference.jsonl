{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n# Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a car driving towards a tower and the angle of elevation changing. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the car is moving towards the base of a vertical tower at a constant speed. Initially, the angle of elevation to the top of the tower is 45 degrees, and then it increases to 60 degrees after 10 minutes. I need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\nI think I should use trigonometry here, specifically the tangent function, since it relates angles to the opposite and adjacent sides in a right triangle. \n\nLet me denote:\n- The height of the tower as h.\n- The initial distance from the car to the tower as d1.\n- The distance after 10 minutes as d2.\n- The speed of the car as v.\n\nFrom the initial position (45° angle), tan(45°) = h / d1. Since tan(45°) is 1, that means h = d1.\n\nAfter 10 minutes, the angle becomes 60°, so tan(60°) = h / d2. We know tan(60°) is √3, so √3 = h / d2, which means d2 = h / √3.\n\nSince h = d1, we can express d2 in terms of d1: d2 = d1 / √3.\n\nThe distance covered by the car in 10 minutes is the difference between d1 and d2. So, distance covered = d1 - d2 = d1 - (d1 / √3) = d1 (1 - 1/√3).\n\nLet's compute 1 - 1/√3. Since √3 is approximately 1.732, 1/√3 ≈ 0.577. So, 1 - 0.577 ≈ 0.423. But I should keep it exact for now.\n\nThe speed v is distance over time, so v = (d1 (1 - 1/√3)) / 10 minutes.\n\nNow, the remaining distance to the base is d2 = d1 / √3. To find the time needed to cover this distance at speed v, time = distance / speed = (d1 / √3) / v.\n\nSubstituting v from above: time = (d1 / √3) / (d1 (1 - 1/√3) / 10) ) = (1 / √3) / ( (1 - 1/√3) / 10 ) = (10 / √3) / (1 - 1/√3).\n\nSimplify the denominator: 1 - 1/√3 = (√3 - 1) / √3.\n\nSo, time = (10 / √3) / ( (√3 - 1) / √3 ) = (10 / √3) * (√3 / (√3 - 1)) = 10 / (√3 - 1).\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by (√3 + 1):\n\n10 (√3 + 1) / ( (√3 - 1)(√3 + 1) ) = 10 (√3 + 1) / (3 - 1) = 10 (√3 + 1) / 2 = 5 (√3 + 1).\n\nSo, the additional time needed is 5(√3 + 1) minutes, which matches option A.","full_output":"Okay, so I need to solve this problem about a car driving towards a tower and the angle of elevation changing.
