This satisfies the condition.\n     - No afternoon reports from Olivia or Robert.\n     - No reports on Monday, as Helen and Robert are on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\n   **Option C:**\n   - Morning: Lenore, Afternoon: Helen\n   - Tuesday: Morning: George, Afternoon: Kyle\n   - Wednesday: Morning: Robert, Afternoon: Irving\n   - **Invalid** because George can report on Tuesday, not Monday.\n\n   **Option D:**\n   - Morning: Nina, Afternoon: Helen\n   - Tuesday: Morning: Robert, Afternoon: Irving\n   - Wednesday: Morning: Olivia, Afternoon: Lenore\n   - **Invalid** because Nina is on Monday, but the schedule doesn't specify Nina's afternoon report.\n\n   **Option E:**\n   - Morning: Olivia, Afternoon: Nina\n   - Tuesday: Morning: Irving, Afternoon: Helen\n   - Wednesday: Morning: Kyle, Afternoon: George\n   - **Invalid** because Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Only **Option B** satisfies all conditions: Nina reports on Wednesday, allowing Helen and Irving to report on Tuesday, and no reports are scheduled on Monday.\n\n\\boxed{B}","ground_truth":"C","predicted_answer":"B","is_correct":false,"from_retry":true}
