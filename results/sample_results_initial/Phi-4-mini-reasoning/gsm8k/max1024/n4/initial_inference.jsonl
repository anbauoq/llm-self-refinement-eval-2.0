First, she eats 3 eggs for breakfast each morning. That leaves her with 16 minus 3, which is 13 eggs. Then, she uses 4 eggs to bake muffins for her friends. So subtracting those 4 from the remaining 13 gives her 13 minus 4 equals 9 eggs left. These remaining eggs she sells at the farmers' market for $2 each. So, multiplying the number of eggs by the price per egg: 9 eggs times $2 per egg. Let me check that math again. 9 times 2 is 18. So, she makes $18 daily from selling the eggs. Wait, did I account for all the eggs correctly? The ducks lay 16, subtract the 3 eaten, then subtract the 4 used for muffins. Yep, that leaves 9. Selling all of those at $2 each should indeed be $18.

The problem says she eats three eggs for breakfast every morning. Then she bakes muffins and uses four eggs for that. After that, she sells the remaining eggs at the market for $2 each. I need to figure out how much money she makes daily from selling the eggs.\n\nFirst, let's break down the numbers. The ducks lay 16 eggs per day. Each day, she starts with those 16 eggs. Then she subtracts the eggs she uses for breakfast and muffins. So, 3 eggs for breakfast and 4 eggs for muffins. That's 3 + 4 = 7 eggs used in total each day. \n\nSo, subtracting those 7 eggs from the original 16 gives 16 - 7 = 9 eggs left to sell. Then, each egg is sold for $2. Therefore, 9 eggs multiplied by $2 per egg equals 9 * 2 = 18. \n\nWait, let me double-check. If she uses 3 eggs each morning, that's per day. Similarly, the 4 eggs for muffins are also daily. So every day, after using 3 + 4 = 7 eggs, she has 9 left. Selling those 9 at $2 each would indeed give her $18 daily. That seems straightforward. I don't think there are any other factors here, like eggs going bad or anything. The problem states \"the remainder\" so it's safe to assume all leftover eggs are sold. So yes, $18 is the correct amount she makes each day.","full_output":"<think>\nOkay, let's see. Janet has ducks that lay 16 eggs each day. So every day, she gets 16 eggs. Then she eats three eggs for breakfast each morning. So right away, those three eggs are subtracted from the total. Then she bakes muffins for her friends every day, and uses four eggs for that. Wait, does that mean she uses four eggs for the muffins, so another four eggs are taken away? So after eating three in the morning, she uses four more for muffins. So total eggs used each day would be 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. Therefore, the remaining eggs she has to sell would be 16 - 7 = 9 eggs. Then she sells the remainder at the market for $2 per egg. So 9 eggs multiplied by $2 each would be 9 * 2 = $18. So she makes $18 each day. Let me double-check. 16 laid, minus 3 for breakfast, leaves 13. Then minus 4 for muffins, that's 9. Then 9 eggs sold at $2 each is $18. Yeah, that seems right. Hmm, but wait—are the eggs used for breakfast and muffins both from the same batch of eggs laid that day? The problem says her ducks lay 16 eggs per day, and then she uses three each morning. So maybe the three are taken each day, and then four more for muffins. So yes, 16 -3 -4 =9.

Since the blue fiber is mentioned first, \"that much\" should be referring to the blue fiber's quantity. So, if the blue fiber is 2 bolts, then half of that would be 2 divided by 2, which is 1. \n\nSo, the white fiber needed is 1 bolt.

Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is saying that after the repairs, the value went up by 150%. So the original value was $80,000. If it increased by 150%, then the new value is 100% + 150% = 250% of the original. So 250% of $80,000 is 2.5 * 80,000 = $200,000. Then the profit would be the final value minus his total investment.

Hmm, breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, how many sprints does he do each week? If he does 3 sprints per session and has 3 sessions a week, that's 3 times 3. Let me calculate that: 3 sprints/session multiplied by 3 sessions equals 9 sprints total per week. Got that part.\n\nNext, each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total distance would be the number of sprints multiplied by the distance per sprint. That's 9 sprints times 60 meters each. Let me do the math: 9 times 60. Well, 9 times 10 is 90, so 90 times 6 is 540. So, 9 times 60 is 540 meters. \n\nWait, is there another way to interpret the problem? Like, maybe \"3 sprints 3","ground_truth":"540","predicted_answer":"540","is_correct":true,"from_retry":false}
