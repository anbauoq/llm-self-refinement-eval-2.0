But since we need two per day, let's check how many are needed. Three days, two each day: total six. Since Kyle and Lenore are out, the six must include George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, Robert. So all six of these six are speaking. Wait, but the problem says exactly six will give reports. So if Kyle and Lenore are not speaking, then the six speakers must be the other six. Therefore, all of George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, Robert will speak. So each of them must give exactly one report over the three days. So each of these six will speak once, on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, each day with two reports (morning and afternoon).\n\nNow, the morning reports for each day (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) are to be filled by three different people, each giving one report (since each person gives exactly one report).

Therefore, in the morning or afternoon of Tuesday, George is giving a report. But since each day has two reports (morning and afternoon), George's report must be on Tuesday. So Tuesday's morning or afternoon slot is George. However, we need to check if the options for the morning reports include George. Let's look at the options:\n\nA) Helen, George, Nina → includes George in the morning of Tuesday.\n\nB) Irving, Robert, Helen → no George here.\n\nC) Nina, Helen, Olivia → no George.\n\nD) Olivia, Robert, Irving → no George.\n\nE) Robert, George, Helen → includes George in Tuesday morning.\n\nSo options B, C, D don't include George in their morning slots, which would conflict with condition 1 because George must speak on Tuesday. Therefore, options B, C, D can be eliminated. That leaves us with options A and E.\n\nWait, but hold on. The question is about the morning reports. So if George is only allowed to speak on Tuesday, then the Tuesday morning (or afternoon) must be George. So in the morning reports for each day, Tuesday's slot must be George. Therefore, in the options A and E, the Tuesday morning slot is George. So that's okay. So options A and E are still possible. But we need to check other constraints as well.\n\n**Condition 2: Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.**\n\nSo Olivia and Robert cannot be in the afternoon slots.

The speakers are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, Robert. All of them must give a report. So each of them must be assigned to either morning or afternoon on their respective days.\n\nBut Olivia and Robert cannot be in the afternoon. Therefore, Olivia and Robert must be in the morning of their respective days. Wait, but each day has one morning and one afternoon.

So, we have eight students, but only six will give reports over three days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each day has two reports: morning and afternoon. The conditions are a bit complex, so I need to break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, the key points from the problem:\n\n1. **George can only speak on Tuesday.** So George's report is fixed to Tuesday. But since each day has two reports, George must be either morning or afternoon on Tuesday.\n\n2. **Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.** So wherever they are scheduled, their time slot must be morning.\n\n3. **If Nina gives a report, then the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.** So if Nina is on Monday, then Tuesday must have both Helen and Irving. If Nina is on Tuesday, then Wednesday must have Helen and Irving. If Nina is on Wednesday, this condition doesn't apply.\n\nNow, the question states that George, Nina, and Robert give reports, each on different days. So each of these three is on a separate day. Since there are three days, each must be on a different day. So one of them is on Monday, another on Tuesday, and the third on Wednesday.\n\nGiven that George can only speak on Tuesday, if George is one of the three (he must be on Tuesday), then Nina and Robert must be on Monday and Wednesday, but on different days. Alternatively, if George is not among the three, but the problem says \"exactly six will give reports and they do so on different days from one another\"—wait, no. Wait, the problem says \"If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another...\" So George, Nina, and Robert each give reports on different days. So each of them is on a separate day. Since there are three days, each must be assigned to one day. So one of them is Monday, another Tuesday, and the third Wednesday.\n\nBut George can only be on Tuesday. So if George is one of the three, he must be on Tuesday, and then Nina and Robert must be on Monday and Wednesday. Alternatively, if George is not among the three, but the problem states that George, Nina, and Robert are the ones giving reports. Wait, the problem says \"If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another...\" So all three are giving reports, each on a different day. So each of them is assigned to a unique day. Since George can only be on Tuesday, that means George is on Tuesday, and Nina and Robert are on Monday and Wednesday on different days.\n\nSo the days for the three are:\n\n- George: Tuesday (fixed)\n\n- Nina: either Monday or Wednesday\n\n- Robert: the remaining day (if Nina is Monday, Robert is Wednesday; if Nina is Wednesday, Robert is Monday)\n\nNow, let's consider the options given (A to E) and see which could be true under these constraints.\n\nLet's go through each option:\n\n**Option A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.**\n\nWe need to check if this is possible. Let's try to construct a possible schedule.\n\nSince George is on Tuesday. Let's assume Nina is on Monday and Robert on Wednesday. But wait, if Nina is on Monday, then the next day (Tuesday) must have Helen and Irving. But Tuesday already has George. So if Nina is on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both be on Tuesday. But Tuesday already has George. That's a problem because each day has two speakers. So if George is on Tuesday, and Nina's presence requires Helen and Irving on Tuesday, but George is already there, that's impossible. Wait, this is a contradiction. Therefore, if Nina is on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both be on Tuesday. But Tuesday already has George. So that's two people on Tuesday, but we can only have two. So George plus Helen and Irving would require three people on Tuesday, which is impossible. Therefore, Nina cannot be on Monday. Therefore, Nina must be on Wednesday. Because if Nina is on Wednesday, the condition about her doesn't affect anything (since the next day would be Tuesday, but Nina is on Wednesday, so the condition only applies if Nina is on Monday or Tuesday). Therefore, if Nina is on Wednesday, then Robert must be on Monday.\n\nSo the days would be:\n\n- Monday: Robert\n\n- Tuesday: George\n\n- Wednesday: Nina\n\nNow, let's check the conditions. Since Nina is on Wednesday, the condition about her not requiring Helen and Irving on Tuesday is satisfied.\n\nNow, Helen is supposed to give a report on Wednesday (Option A). But Wednesday's speakers are Nina and someone else. Wait, each day has two speakers. So on Wednesday, Nina is one, and the other could be Helen. But Helen's presence on Wednesday is allowed.
