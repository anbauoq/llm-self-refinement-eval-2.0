Since the plane is flying along the four sides of a square, the total distance is 4 times the length of one side. Let's call the length of one side's'. The total distance is 4s. To find the total time taken, we need to find the time taken to travel each side and add them up. The time taken to travel a side is the distance of the side divided by the speed of the plane. So the time taken to travel the first side is s/200, the second side is s/400, the third side is s/600, and the fourth side is s/800. The total time taken is s/200 + s/400 + s/600 + s/800.

The next 4 numbers are then x + 2, x + 4, x + 6, and x + 8. The sum of these numbers is x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) + (x + 6) + (x + 8) = 5x + 20. We are given that when this sum is divided by 10, it becomes a perfect square. This means 5x + 20 is a multiple of 10, and since the remainder when dividing by 10 is 0, it is also a multiple of 10. We can express it as 5x + 20 = 10k, where k is an integer. Simplifying, we get 5x = 10k - 20, or x = 2k - 4. Since x is a two-digit odd number, it must be greater than or equal to 10 and less than 100. The smallest possible value of k is 3, which gives x = 2(3) - 4 = 2. But 2 is less than 10, so we must try a larger value of k. If we let k = 4, then x = 2(4) - 4 = 4, which is still less than 10. Let k = 5, then x = 2(5) - 4 = 6. Still less than 10.

However, the question asks for the perimeter of the original square, and we must choose the correct option, so we can see that 72 is not an option. We can find the side length of the square by using the fact that the two triangles together have an area of 140, and each triangle has a base of (14 - 4)/2 = 5 and height of 10. The area of a triangle is (base * height)/2, so (5 * 10)/2 = 25. The area of each triangle is 70, so the total area is 140.

Since the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, let's assume the winning candidate got x votes. The other candidate got x - 0.15x = 0.85x votes. The total number of votes is 4,000, so x + 0.85x = 4,000, which simplifies to 1.85x = 4,000. Solving for x gives x = 4,000 / 1.85 = 2162.16. Since we can't have a fraction of a vote, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 2162. However, this is not an option. We must have made an error in our assumption.

The train N travels for 2.5 hours to cover the distance from B to A. The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their individual speeds. Let's assume the speed of M is S1 and the speed of N is S2. The time taken by M to cover the distance is 4 hours, so distance = 4 * S1. The time taken by N to cover the distance is 2.5 hours, so distance = 2.5 * S2. Since distance is the same, we can equate the two: 4S1 = 2.5S2. We want to find the time when they meet, which is the time when the distance covered by M is equal to the distance covered by N. We can use the concept of relative speed to find this time. The relative speed of the two trains is S1 + S2. The time taken by M to cover the distance is 4 hours, and the time taken by N to cover the same distance is 2.5 hours. We can use the formula: time = distance / relative speed. The distance is the same for both trains, so we can equate the two: 4 / (S1 + S2) = 2.5 / S2. Cross-multiplying, we get: 4S2 = 2.5S1 + 2.5S2.

Find Mohan's share.\n\nOptions:\nA)2400\nB)2500\nC)2600\nD)2700\nE)None of these","full_output":"<think>Mohan and Sohan are 23 and 24 years old now. They will be 26 years old in 3 years. The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r)^n, where A is the amount, P is the principal amount, r is the annual interest rate, and n is the number of years. We want the amount they receive at 26 to be the same, so we set up the equation: 5100 * (1 + 0.04)^3 = x * (1 + 0.04)^3, where x is Mohan's share. Since the 3-year term appears on both sides, we can cancel it out: 5100 = x. This is the amount they will have in 3 years, so Mohan's share now is 5100 / (1 + 0.04)^3 = 5100 / (1.04)^3. Now we can calculate the value of (1.04)^3, which is approximately 1.125984. Now we can calculate 5100 / 1.125984, which is approximately 4538.19. But Mohan's share is given in the options, and we can see that the closest option is 4500, but we have to see if the other option is correct. The amount Mohan will get after 3 years is 5100 * (1.04)^3 = 4538.19. We can calculate the amount he would get if he got 2400 now, using the formula A = P(1 + r)^n. 2400 * (1.04)^3 = 2400 * 1.125984 = 2701.35504. Since 2701.35504 is greater than 4538.19, Mohan getting 2400 now would give him more than he needs to get 4538.19 in 3 years. The other options (2500, 2600, 2700) would also give him more than he needs. So, the only option that is less than 4538.19 is option A, 2400. However, this is not correct because Mohan needs 4538.19 in 3 years and 2400 now would give him more than he needs. Therefore, the only option left is option E, None of these.

This is approximately (8/81) * 100 = 9.9%, which is closest to option C (10% is too high, so it must be lower than that). Therefore, we must have made an error somewhere. Let's reevaluate the amount left after each feeding session: At 8:00 am, the bowl is full. At 9:00 am, the dog eats 1","predicted_answer":null,"ground_truth":"A","is_correct":null,"was_retried":true}

Let the length of the unpainted side be L and the length of the longer side be W. Then L + W + W = 37, so 2W + L = 37. We also know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. The area of the parking space is the product of the length of the unpainted side and the length of the longer side, which is LW. We can now solve for L and W: 2W + L = 37 and LW = 9 * (37 - L) / 2 = 9 * 37 / 2 - 9L / 2 = 9 * 37 / 2 - 4.5L. Now we have LW = 9 * 37 / 2 - 4.","predicted_answer":null,"ground_truth":"C","is_correct":null,"was_retried":true}

This can be calculated using combinations: C(n, 2) = n! / (2!(n-2)!) = (n * (n - 1)) / 2. However, we need to exclude the cases where the ball with the number 3 is selected. This can be done in two ways: either the first ball is the one with the number 3 or the second ball is the one with the number 3. If the first ball is the one with the number 3, there are (n - 1) choices for the second ball. If the second ball is the one with the number 3, there are (n - 1) choices for the first ball. Therefore, the total number of ways to select two balls such that the ball with the number 3 is not selected is (n - 1) + (n - 1) = 2(n - 1). We are given that this number is equal to 45. Therefore, we can write the equation 2(n - 1) = 45. To solve for n, we can divide both sides by 2, giving us (n - 1) = 22.5. However, n must be a whole number, so we try the nearest whole numbers, n = 23 and n = 24. We can plug in n = 23 to check if it satisfies the equation: 2(23 - 1) = 2(22) = 44, which is less than 45. Therefore, we try n = 24: 2(24 - 1) = 2(23) = 46, which is greater than 45. Therefore, we try the next whole number, n = 23 and n = 24, and the values in between them.

Since Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. He finishes two-thirds of the work, so he completes 2/3 of the yacht. The remaining work is 1/3 of the yacht. Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate, so Jill's rate is 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour. To find the time it takes Jill to finish the remaining work, we can divide the remaining work (1/3 of the yacht) by Jill's rate (1/240 of the yacht per hour). This gives us (1/3) / (1/240) = (1/3) * (240/1) = 80 hours. However, we are told that the remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. Since Jack cleaned 2/3 of the yacht, then the remaining 1/3 of the yacht must have taken him 6 hours to clean.

We know that Jill cleans at 5% of Jack's rate, and Jack cleans 1/12 of the yacht per hour. Therefore, Jill cleans 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour. Since Jill cleans 1/3 of the yacht in 6 hours, her rate of cleaning must be 1/3 / 6 = 1/18 of the yacht per hour. Now we can find Jill's rate in terms of Jack's rate. Jack cleans 1/12 of the yacht per hour, and Jill cleans 1/18 of the yacht per hour. The ratio of Jill's rate to Jack's rate is (1/18) / (1/12) = (1/18) * (12/1) = 2/3.
