The outer cube has a size of 5cm, but it has a thickness of 1cm. This means the outer cube is actually made of 5 smaller cubes in each dimension (5 x 5 x 5), but the inner 3x3x3 smaller cubes are hollow and do not have paint. The outer 2x2x2 smaller cubes on each face are painted, but the inner 1x1x1 smaller cube on each face is not painted. So, the number of unpainted faces is the number of inner 1x1x1 cubes on each face that are not painted. There are 6 faces on the cube, and on each face, there is one 1x1x1 cube that is not painted. Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces is 6 * 1 = 6. However, we must also account for the unpainted faces of the smaller cubes on the edges and the corners. Each edge has a 1x1x1 smaller cube that is not painted, and there are 12 edges on the cube. Each corner has a 1x1x1 smaller cube that is not painted, and there are 8 corners on the cube. So, the total number of unpainted faces on the edges is 12 * 1 = 12, and the total number of unpainted faces on the corners is 8 * 3 = 24 (since each corner has 3 faces that are not painted). Therefore, the total number of unpainted faces is 6 + 12 + 24 = 42. However, this counts the faces on the edges and corners twice, so we must subtract the number of faces that are on both edges and corners. Each edge has 2 faces that are also on a corner, and there are 12 edges. Therefore, the number of faces that are on both edges and corners is 12 * 2 = 24.
