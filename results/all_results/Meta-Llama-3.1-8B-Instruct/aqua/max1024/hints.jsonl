The plane will travel 163.64 + 180 = 343.64 miles before they meet. The initial distance between them was 180 miles, so the distance when they meet from the starting point is 180 + 163.64 = 343.64 miles, which is option B.","full_output":"<think>Let the speed of the ship be s. The plane travels 10 times faster, so its speed is 10s. After the ship has traveled 180 miles, the plane starts. Let's say the plane travels for t hours before they meet. During this time, the ship travels for t hours and the plane travels for t hours. The distance traveled by the ship is st and the distance traveled by the plane is 10st. The total distance traveled by both the ship and the plane is 180 + 10st. Since they meet after t hours, the total distance traveled by both is equal to the initial distance between them, which is 180. So, 180 + 10st = 180. Subtracting 180 from both sides gives 10st = 0, so st = 0. This means that the ship and the plane meet after 0 hours. However, this is a paradox. Instead, we need to consider that the ship travels for some time before the plane starts. Let's say the ship travels for t1 hours before the plane starts. Then, the ship travels for t1 hours and the plane travels for t1 hours. The distance traveled by the ship is st1 and the distance traveled by the plane is 10st1. The total distance traveled by both the ship and the plane is st1 + 10st1. Since they meet after t1 hours, the total distance traveled by both is equal to the initial distance between them, which is 180. So, st1 + 10st1 = 180. Factoring out st1 gives st1(1 + 10) = 180, so 11st1 = 180. Dividing both sides by 11 gives st1 = 180/11 = 16.36. Since the ship travels for t1 hours before the plane starts, the time it takes for the ship to travel 180 miles is t1 + t2, where t2 is the time the plane travels before they meet. The distance traveled by the ship is st1 + st2. Since the ship travels 180 miles, we know that st1 + st2 = 180. We also know that st1 = 16.36s. Since the plane travels 10 times faster than the ship, we know that 10st2 = 180 - 16.36s. Dividing both sides by 10 gives st2 = 16.78s. We now have two equations: st1 + st2 = 180 and st1 = 16.36s. Substituting st1 = 16.36s into the first equation gives 16.36s + st2 = 180. We know that st2 = 16.78s, so we can substitute this in to get 16.36s + 16.78s = 180. Combining like terms gives 33.14s = 180. Dividing both sides by 33.14 gives s = 5.45. The time it takes for the ship to travel 180 miles is t1 + t2. We know that st1 = 16.36s and st2 = 16.78s. Dividing both sides of each equation by s gives t1 = 16.36 and t2 = 16.78. The total time is t1 + t2 = 16.36 + 16.78 = 33.14. The distance traveled by the ship is st1 + st2 = 180. We know that st1 = 16.36s and st2 = 16.78s. Dividing both sides of each equation by s gives t1 = 16.36 and t2 = 16.78. The distance traveled by the ship is 180 = 16.36s + 16.78s. Combining like terms gives 180 = 33.14s. Dividing both sides by 33.14 gives s = 5.45. The ship travels for 16.36 hours before the plane starts. The plane travels for 16.78 hours before they meet. The distance traveled by the ship is 180 = 16.36s + 16.78s. Combining like terms gives 180 = 33.14s. Dividing both sides by 33.14 gives s = 5.45. The ship travels for 16.36 hours before the plane starts, so the ship travels 16.36 * 5.45 = 89.06 miles before the plane starts.

This simplifies to n = (17/3 ± sqrt((-17/3)^2 - 4(1)(500/3))) / 2(1).

If x = 5, then the number of brass coins is (340 - 100) / 25 = 240 / 25 = 9.6, which is not an integer. So x = 5 is not possible. The next multiple of 5 is 10, so let x = 10. Then the number of brass coins is (340 - 200) / 25 = 140 / 25 = 5.6, which is not an integer. The next multiple of 5 is 15, so let x = 15. Then the number of brass coins is (340 - 300) / 25 = 40 / 25 = 1.6, which is not an integer. The next multiple of 5 is 20, so let x = 20. Then the number of brass coins is (340 - 400) / 25 = -60 / 25 = -2.4, which is not an integer. The next multiple of 5 is 25, so let x = 25. Then the number of brass coins is (340 - 500) / 25 = -160 / 25 = -6.4, which is not an integer. The next multiple of 5 is 30, so let x = 30. Then the number of brass coins is (340 - 600) / 25 = -260 / 25 = -10.4, which is not an integer. The next multiple of 5 is 35, so let x = 35. Then the number of brass coins is (340 - 700) / 25 = -360 / 25 = -14.4, which is not an integer. The next multiple of 5 is 40, so let x = 40. Then the number of brass coins is (340 - 800) / 25 = -460 / 25 = -18.4, which is not an integer. The next multiple of 5 is 45, so let x = 45. Then the number of brass coins is (340 - 900) / 25 = -560 / 25 = -22.4, which is not an integer. The next multiple of 5 is 50, so let x = 50. Then the number of brass coins is (340 - 1000) / 25 = -660 / 25 = -26.4, which is not an integer. The next multiple of 5 is 55, so let x = 55. Then the number of brass coins is (340 - 1100) / 25 = -760 / 25 = -30.4, which is not an integer. The next multiple of 5 is 60, so let x = 60. Then the number of brass coins is (340 - 1200) / 25 = -860 / 25 = -34.4, which is not an integer. The next multiple of 5 is 65, so let x = 65. Then the number of brass coins is (340 - 1300) / 25 = -960 / 25 = -38.4, which is not an integer. The next multiple of 5 is 70, so let x = 70. Then the number of brass coins is (340 - 1400) / 25 = -1060 / 25 = -42.4, which is not an integer. The next multiple of 5 is 75, so let x = 75.

The time it takes for train M to travel from A to C is the same as the time it takes for train N to travel from C to B.

We are given that the sum is 51 and the first integer is -50. Let the last integer be x. Then k/2 * (-50 + x) = 51. We can multiply both sides by 2 to get k * (-50 + x) = 102. We can also write the sum as k/2 * (first integer + last integer) = k/2 * (-50 + x + 50 + (k-1)) = k * (x + (k-1)/2). Since we know k * (-50 + x) = 102 and k * (x + (k-1)/2) = 102, we can equate these two expressions and solve for k: -50k + kx = 102 and kx + k(k-1)/2 = 102. We can solve the first equation for kx: kx = 102 + 50k. Substituting this into the second equation, we get 102 + 50k + k(k-1)/2 = 102. Subtracting 102 from both sides gives us 50k + k(k-1)/2 = 0. Multiplying both sides by 2 gives us 100k + k(k-1) = 0. Distributing the k gives us 100k + k^2 - k = 0. Rearranging the terms gives us k^2 + 99k = 0.

Therefore, we must have L(x,y) > R(x,y), but this is impossible since we already established that L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y) and L(x,y) cannot be less than R(x,y).

Then 2/5x = G and 3/5x = 100. We are given that G is 2/5 of the class. We know that the boys are 3/5 of the class, so the girls are 2/5 of the class. We can set up the equation 3/5x = 100. Multiply both sides by 5/3 to get x = 100 * (5/3) = 500/3. But again, x must be a whole number. So let’s think about this another way. We know that the boys make up 3/5 of the class, so the girls make up 2/5 of the class. We are given that the boys are 100. We are given that 2/5 of the class are girls. This means that 2/5 of the total number of students is equal to the number of girls. We know that the boys are 3/5 of the class. This means that 3/5 of the total number of students is equal to the number of boys. We are given that the number of boys is 100. Let the total number of students be x.

So let’s try to solve for x using the fact that the boys are 100. If the boys are 100, then the total number of children in the class must be a multiple of 5. So let’s try to find the smallest multiple of 5 that is greater than 100. The smallest multiple of 5 greater than 100 is 105. Let’s try x = 105. Then 3/5 * 105 = 63, which is not equal to 100.

Subtract (2/5)x from both sides to get (3/5)x = 100. Multiply both sides by 5/3 to get x = 100 * (5/3) = 500/3. But we know the total number of children must be a whole number. To make it a whole number, we can multiply the whole equation by 3: 3x = 3(100) and 3(2/5)x = 3 * (2/5)x. This gives us 3x = 300 + 6x/5. Multiply both sides by 5 to get 15x = 1500 + 6x.
