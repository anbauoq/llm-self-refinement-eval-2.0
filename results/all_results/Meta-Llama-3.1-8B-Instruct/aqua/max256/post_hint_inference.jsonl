Let's represent the total number of matches played as 'T'. We know that the number of matches they lost is 30% of T, which is 0.30T. We are also given that the team won 20 matches, so the total number of matches played is the sum of the number of matches won and lost: T = 20 + 0.30T. To solve for T, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 0.30T from both sides: T - 0.30T = 20. Combining like terms gives us 0.70T = 20. To solve for T, we need to divide both sides by 0.70: T = 20 / 0.70 = 28.57. Since the total number of matches played must be a multiple of 10, we can round up to the nearest multiple of 10.
