So the total number of steps is 40. Now, we can find the speed of the elevator. When you walk 20 steps and stop, the elevator moves 40 - 20 = 20 steps in 10 minutes, so its speed is 20 / 10 = 2 steps/minute. This matches option B.","full_output":"<think>Let the speed of the elevator be x steps per minute. When you walk 20 steps and stop, you effectively need to cover 20 steps in the time it takes the elevator to move the remaining distance. Since you reach the bottom in 10 minutes, let's assume the total number of steps is N. Then, in 10 minutes, the elevator moves N - 20 steps. So, the time taken by the elevator to move N - 20 steps is 10 minutes. This means the elevator's speed is (N - 20) / 10. When you walk 10 steps and stop, you cover 10 steps in the time it takes the elevator to move the remaining distance. In 20 minutes, the elevator moves N - 10 steps. So, the elevator's speed is (N - 10) / 20. Since the elevator's speed is the same in both cases, we can equate the two expressions: (N - 20) / 10 = (N - 10) / 20.

Then, the number of students who took only physics is 20% of N - x = 0.2N - x, and the number of students who took only math is 28% of N - x = 0.28N - x. The total number of students who took physics or math is the sum of the students who took only physics, only math, and both. This sum must be at least 501 (since there are more than 501 students in the school). Therefore, we have: (0.2N - x) + (0.28N - x) + x >= 501.

The amount of orange juice in the initial 1 gallon is 40% of 1, which is 0.4 gallons. The amount of water is 60% of 1, which is 0.6 gallons. We want to add x gallons of orange juice to get 60% orange juice in the total mixture. The total mixture will then be 1 + x gallons. The amount of orange juice in the total mixture will be 0.4 + x. The amount of water in the total mixture will be 0.6. We are given that the orange juice should be 60% of the total mixture. So, we can write (0.4 + x) / (1 + x) = 0.6. To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 0.4 + x = 0.6 * (1 + x). Expanding the right-hand side, we get 0.4 + x = 0.6 + 0.6x. Subtracting 0.4 from both sides, we get x = 0.2 + 0.6x.

Since each voter has a 90% chance of having voted, we can model this as a binomial distribution with n=5 and p=0.9. The probability of exactly 4 successes is given by the binomial probability formula: P(X=k) = (nCk) * (p^k) * (1-p)^(n-k). In this case, nCk = 5C4 = 5, p^k = 0.9^4 = 0.6561, and (1-p)^(n-k) = (0.1)^1 = 0.1. So, P(X=4) = 5 * 0.6561 * 0.1 = 0.32805.
