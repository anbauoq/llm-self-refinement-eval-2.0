Let d be the distance from the car to the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is 45°. When the angle of elevation is 60°, the distance from the car to the base of the tower is d + x, where x is the additional distance the car needs to cover. We can then write: tan(45°) / tan(60°) = d / (d + x). We know that tan(45°) = 1 and tan(60°) = √3. Substituting these values in the equation, we get: 1 / √3 = d / (d + x). Cross-multiplying, we get: d + x = √3d. Subtracting d from both sides, we get: x = (√3 - 1)d. We are given that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. Let t be the additional time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower. We know that the car travels at a uniform speed, so the ratio of the distances covered is equal to the ratio of the times taken. We can then write: d / (d + x) = 10 / (10 + t). Substituting x = (√3 - 1)d into this equation, we get: d / (d + (√3 - 1)d) = 10 / (10 + t). Simplifying, we get: d / (√3d) = 10 / (10 + t). Cross-multiplying, we get: (10 + t) = 10√3.

Since a and c are digits, a can be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9, but a > c, so a ≥ c + 1. If a = 9, then 3c = 1, which has no solution, so a ≠ 9.

We can substitute this into the first equation to get 0.3(20 + y) + 20 = y. We can simplify this to get 6 + 0.3y + 20 = y. We can combine the constants to get 26 + 0.3y = y. We can subtract 0.3y from both sides to get 26 = 0.7y. We can divide both sides by 0.7 to get 26 / 0.7 = y. We can calculate this to get y = 37.14. However, the team can't have played a fraction of a match. We can round down to 37 matches. However, we know that the team won 20 matches. We can use this to find the number of matches lost.

We can write the equation 0.3x = y - 20, where x is the total number of matches, y is the number of matches lost, and 20 is the number of matches won. We can also write the equation x = 20 + y. We can substitute this into the first equation to get 0.3(20 + y) = y - 20. We can simplify this to get 6 + 0.3y = y - 20. We can add 20 to both sides to get 26 + 0.3y = y.

We are told that the median income is $3000, so x3 = 3000. The total income is $9000, so x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5 + x6 = 9000. We know that x3 = 3000, so x1 + x2 + 3000 + x4 + x5 + x6 = 9000, which simplifies to x1 + x2 + x4 + x5 + x6 = 6000. Since x3 = 3000, the list of incomes in order is x1, x2, 3000, x4, x5, x6. Since there are 6 incomes and 3000 is the median, there must be 3 incomes greater than 3000 and 3 incomes less than 3000. Therefore, x4, x5, and x6 must be greater than 3000, and x1, x2, and x4, x5, x6 are all the incomes. So x1, x2, x4, x5, x6 = 6000, and x4 + x5 + x6 = 6000 - (x1 + x2). Since x1, x2, x4, x5, x6 are all the incomes, the sum of the incomes is the total income, which is 9000.

This is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that x4, x5, and x6 are all greater than 3000 must be false. Therefore, either x4, x5, or x6 is less than or equal to 3000.

The interest rate he pays is then 800 / (20000 / 100) = 800 / 200 = 4. This is the interest rate he can afford to pay, and it's less than 4.74, which is option A.

Simple interest (SI) is given by the formula SI = (P * r * t)/100, where P is principal and t is time in years. The compound interest (CI) is given by the formula A = P(1 + r/100)^t, where A is the amount after t years, and CI = A - P. We are given that SI - CI = 72. So, we need to find the rate of interest r for which this is true. First, let's find the amount after 2 years for a principal of Rs.5000 at a rate r. A = 5000(1 + r/100)^2. CI = A - 5000. Now, let's find the simple interest. SI = (5000 * r * 2)/100 = 100r. We are given that SI - CI = 72. So, 100r - (5000(1 + r/100)^2 - 5000) = 72. Simplifying, we get 100r - 5000(1 + 2r/100 + r^2/10000) = 72. Expanding the equation, we get 100r - 5000 - 100r - 100r/100 + 5000r/10000 = 72. Combining like terms, we get -r/100 + 5000r/10000 = 72.

Since r is the rate of interest, we need to find the percentage. r = 180/100 = 1.8. Converting to percentage, we get r = 180%. However, a rate of interest cannot be more than 100%. So, we need to consider a lower value of r that gives the same difference between SI and CI. By trial and error, we can see that r = 8 gives the correct answer. We can also see that r = 8 is the only possible answer, as any higher value of r would give a negative value for r/100 - 5000r/10000 in the equation -r/100 + 5000r/10000 = 72, which is not possible.

{"id":224,"question":"A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?\n\nOptions:\nA)46\nB)81\nC)126\nD)252\nE)None","chain_of_thought":"Let's call the length of the painted sides x and y. We are given that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so x + y = 37. We are also given that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. Since the unpainted side is opposite to one of the painted sides, the other two sides are x and 9. Therefore, the area of the parking space is 9 * (x + y) = 9 * 37 = 333. However, we also know that the area can be represented as 9 * y, where y is one of the sides. From the equation x + y = 37, we can express x as x = 37 - y. We can substitute this expression for x in the area equation 9 * y to get 9 * (37 - y) = 333. Simplifying the equation, we get 333 = 333 - 9y. Subtracting 333 from both sides gives -9y = 0. Dividing both sides by -9 gives y = 0, which is impossible since y is a length and cannot be zero. Therefore, our initial assumption that the unpainted side is opposite to one of the painted sides must be incorrect. The unpainted side must be adjacent to both painted sides. The area of the parking space is then 9 * y. From the equation x + y = 37, we can express x as x = 37 - y. We can substitute this expression for x in the equation 9x + 9y = 37x + 37y = 37(9 + y) = 333 to get 9x + 9y = 333. Simplifying the equation, we get 9x + 9y = 333. We also know that 9x + 9y = 9(x + y). We are given that x + y = 37. Therefore, 9(x + y) = 9 * 37 = 333. Since we have two equations 9x + 9y = 333 and 9(x + y) = 333, they are equivalent. We can express y in terms of x using the equation x + y = 37. y = 37 - x. We can substitute this expression for y in the equation 9x + 9y = 333. 9x + 9(37 - x) = 333. Simplifying the equation, we get 9x + 333 - 9x = 333. The 9x terms cancel out. 333 = 333. This is true for any value of x. However, we know that x + y = 37 and x and y are lengths. We can find the value of x by using the fact that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. We are given that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet.

We can express y in terms of x using the equation x + y = 37. y = 37 - x. We can substitute this expression for y in the equation x + y = 37. x + (37 - x) = 37. Simplifying the equation, we get 37 = 37. This is true for any value of x. However, we know that x + y = 37 and x and y are lengths. Since x and y are lengths, they must be positive.

Since x + y = 37 and x and y are lengths, x and y must be positive. The maximum value of x is 37 - 1 = 36, which is still positive. We can find the area of the parking space by using the formula area = length * width. We can represent the length and width as x and 9. The area of the parking space is then 9x. We are given that x + y = 37. We can express y in terms of x using the equation x + y = 37. y = 37 - x. Since x + y = 37 and x and y are lengths, x and y must be positive. We can find the value of x by finding the value of y that makes the area of the parking space equal to one of the given options. We can find the value of x by finding the value of y that makes the area of the parking space equal to 81. The area of the parking space is 9y. We are given that the area of the parking space is 81. Therefore, 9y = 81. Dividing both sides by 9 gives y = 9. We can substitute y = 9 in the equation x + y = 37 to get x + 9 = 37. Subtracting 9 from both sides gives x = 28.
