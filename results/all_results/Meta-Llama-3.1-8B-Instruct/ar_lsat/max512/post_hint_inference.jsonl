Also, since Julio's session is on Thursday afternoon, Olivia's session must be on Friday. Now we have: Thursday: Julio, Nessa, Kevin/Rebecca and Friday: Lan, Olivia, Kevin/Rebecca, Nessa. Kevin and Rebecca can only be on Thursday or Friday together, and Nessa must be on the same day as Kevin and Rebecca. If Kevin and Rebecca are on Thursday, then Nessa is on Thursday and the only remaining session on Thursday is Julio's. If Kevin and Rebecca are on Friday, then Nessa is on Friday and the only remaining session on Friday is Lan's. However, the problem asks how many other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead. In both cases, we can only determine which sessions Julio and Nessa lead, which is two, and in the case where Kevin and Rebecca are on Friday, we can also determine which session Lan leads. Therefore, the total number of lab assistants that can be determined is three, when Kevin and Rebecca are on Friday.</think>\n<ans>C</ans>","ground_truth":"C","predicted_answer":"C","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}
