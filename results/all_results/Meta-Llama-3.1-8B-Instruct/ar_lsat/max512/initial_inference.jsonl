Now consider the possible combinations of the remaining four colors (forest, turquoise, white, and yellow) and the rule that white is used with two other colors in a rug. If forest is used with white, then the other rug must be turquoise because forest and turquoise are not used together, and turquoise and yellow are not used together. This leaves yellow and white in the other rug, so option D is true. If turquoise is used with white, then the other rug must be forest because forest and turquoise are not used together, and forest and yellow are not used together. This leaves yellow and white in the other rug, so option E is true. If yellow is used with white, then the other rug must be forest because forest and yellow are not used together, and forest and turquoise are not used together. This leaves turquoise and white in the other rug, so option D is true. If white is used in only one rug, then the other three colors must be used in the other two rugs.

The only remaining option is that Mollie is assigned to the year 1921 or 1922. If Mollie is assigned to the year 1921, then the other years must be assigned to the other three students.

However, the problem states that all four students must be assigned to the project, so Tiffany cannot be assigned to the year 1921. Therefore, Yoshio, Louis, and Tiffany could be assigned to the year 1921, and Mollie could be assigned to the year 1922, or Mollie could be assigned to the year 1921 and Yoshio could be assigned to the year 1922.

To end up with only class 2 buildings, RealProp must trade away all its class 1 and class 3 buildings. Trading away the class 1 Garza Tower is easy. To trade away the class 3 buildings, RealProp can use the rule that allows trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. However, this rule cannot be used to trade away the class 3 buildings because it requires two class 3 buildings to be traded for one class 2 building. So RealProp must have traded away all its class 3 buildings before it could trade away the class 2 buildings. The only way RealProp could have traded away the class 3 buildings is by using the rule that allows trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. This rule can only be used to trade away class 2 buildings, not class 3 buildings, so RealProp must have traded away some of its class 2 buildings before it could trade away the class 3 buildings.
