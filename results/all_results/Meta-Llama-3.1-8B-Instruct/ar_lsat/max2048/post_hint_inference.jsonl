This means Greene's oil must be on a different wall. Since no wall has only one student's work, it must be on a wall with Isaacs's work, who is already on wall 4. So wall 4 must be either Greene or Isaacs and another student. Since Isaacs's oil is on the lower position of wall 4, it can't be Greene, so Isaacs must be on wall 4 with another student, and that student is either Hidalgo or Franz. Since no wall has both Franz and Isaacs, it must be Hidalgo on wall 4. Now we know wall 4 is Hidalgo and Isaacs.

Since no wall has only one student's work, Greene must be on wall 1 or 2 with either Franz or Hidalgo.
