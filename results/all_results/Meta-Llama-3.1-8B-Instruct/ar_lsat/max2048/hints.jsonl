\n- No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. This means that each wall must have at least one oil painting.\n- No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. This means that each wall must have at least two students' work displayed on it.\n- No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
