This means they must be on days 3, 4, or 5, or some combination of these days. Since Himalayans are on exactly three days, and they are not on day 1 or 2, they must be on days 3, 4, and 5. Greyhounds are on day 1, so days 2, 3, 4, and 5 are already taken. Day 6 must be a puppy breed that isn’t a Rottweiler (because Rottweilers aren’t featured on days with Himalayans), so it must be a Greyhound or a Newfoundland. Day 7 must be a kitten breed that isn’t a Himalayan, and isn’t a breed that was featured on day 1, so it must be a Manx or a Siamese. Therefore, the only option that could be true is E, which says Greyhounds are featured on day 7, but this option is incorrect because it says Greyhounds are featured on day 7, but we know that Himalayans are featured on days 3, 4, and 5. Since Himalayans are on days 3, 4, and 5, and Greyhounds are on day 1, day 6 must be a Greyhound or a Newfoundland and day 7 must be a Manx or a Siamese. This means that the correct option must be one of the following: A, B, C, or D. We know that Himalayans are featured on days 3, 4, and 5, and Greyhounds are featured on day 1. Since Greyhounds are featured on day 1, and Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, and are not featured on day 1, day 2 must be a Siamese or a Manx. Since Himalayans are featured on days 3, 4, and 5, and Greyhounds are featured on day 1, day 6 must be a Greyhound or a Newfoundland. Since Himalayans are featured on days 3, 4, and 5, and Greyhounds are featured on day 1, day 7 must be a Manx or a Siamese. Since Himalayans are featured on days 3, 4, and 5, day 3 must be a Manx or a Siamese. Day 3 cannot be a Siamese because if it is, then day 4 must be a Manx because Himalayans are featured on days 3, 4, and 5, and day 5 must be a Siamese, which is not allowed. Therefore, day 3 must be a Manx. Since Himalayans are featured on days 3, 4, and 5, and Greyhounds are featured on day 1, day 6 must be a Greyhound or a Newfoundland. Since day 3 is a Manx, day 4 must be a Siamese because Himalayans are featured on days 3, 4, and 5. Since day 4 is a Siamese, day 5 must be a Manx because Himalayans are featured on days 3, 4, and 5. Since day 5 is a Manx, day 6 must be a Greyhound or a Newfoundland. Day 6 cannot be a Greyhound because Greyhounds are featured on day 1, and are not featured on day 7, but since Himalayans are featured on days 3, 4, and 5, and are not featured on day 7, day 7 must be a Manx or a Siamese. Therefore, day 6 must be a Newfoundland. Since day 4 is a Siamese, and day 5 is a Manx, and day 6 is a Newfoundland, day 7 must be a Siamese.
