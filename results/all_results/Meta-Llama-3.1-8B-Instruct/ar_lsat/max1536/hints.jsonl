However, option D could be modified to restrict M's season to spring if N is published in spring, and M cannot be published in the same season as P. Therefore option D, \"If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring\" could be modified to \"If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring, and M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other\" and have the same effect as the original condition. However, without the modification, option D does not have the same effect as the original condition. Option D cannot be used on its own. However, C has the same effect as the original condition in the sense that if M is in the spring, P must be in the fall, and if M is in the fall, N must be in the spring.
