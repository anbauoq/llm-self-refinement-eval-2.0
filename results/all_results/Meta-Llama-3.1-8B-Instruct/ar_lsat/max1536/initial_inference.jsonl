Since each day has a batch of a different kind of cookie, we can denote Monday = O1 = P1 = S3 as the only possibility. Now let’s look at the options: A says at least one batch is made each day, which is true since we have a batch on each day. B says at least two batches are made on Wednesday, which is true since Wednesday = O3 = P2 = S1. C says exactly one batch is made on Monday, which is false since we have three batches on Monday. D says exactly two batches are made on Tuesday, which is true since Tuesday = O4 = P3 = S2. E says exactly one batch is made on Friday, which is true since Friday = O5 = P4 = S3. Therefore, the only statement that could be false is C, which is option C.</think>\n<ans>C</ans>","ground_truth":"E","predicted_answer":"C","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Udall and Stuckey work in the same zone, this zone must be Zone 3. Now we know that Mahr, Udall, and Stuckey work in Zone 3. Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) work in Zone 2, this means that Tiao works in Zone 2. Now we know that Tiao and Udall work in Zone 2. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and there are only three zones, this means that Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3. Since we already know that Mahr, Udall, and Stuckey work in Zone 3, this means that Parra and Quinn must work in the same zone as Mahr, Udall, and Stuckey. However, this is not possible since there are only three zones and four people. This means that our initial assumption that Mahr, Udall, and Stuckey work in Zone 3 must be incorrect. Therefore, Mahr and Stuckey must work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2. If Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 2, then Udall also works in Zone 2, which means that Tiao works in Zone 1. If Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 1, then Udall also works in Zone 1, which means that Tiao works in Zone 2. Given that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, this means that Parra works in Zone 1 in the first case and Tiao works in Zone 1 in the second case. Therefore, in both cases, either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1. This means that option B could be true, as it states that Mahr works in Zone 1, which is true in the first case.</think>\n<ans>B</ans>","ground_truth":"A","predicted_answer":"B","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

If J is second, G can be third or later, but we've already established that Q must be at least three positions after S, and Y must be at least two positions after S. If J is third, G can be fourth or later, but we've already established that Q must be at least three positions after S, and Y must be at least two positions after S. If J is fourth, G can be fifth or later, but we've already established that Q must be at least three positions after S, and Y must be at least two positions after S. If J is fifth, G can be sixth or later, but we've already established that Q must be at least three positions after S, and Y must be at least two positions after S. If J is sixth or seventh, G can be seventh or later, but we've already established that Q must be at least three positions after S, and Y must be at least two positions after S. This pattern holds for all positions of J, so G must be at least two positions after J. Finally, we'll look at S's relationship with all other articles: S must be earlier than Y, and S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. This means S can't be first, second, or third if Q is first or second. If Q is first, S could be fourth or later. If Q is second, S could be third or later. If Q is third, S could be first, second, third, or fourth. If Q is fourth, S could be first, second, third, fourth, or fifth. If Q is fifth, S could be first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth. If Q is sixth or seventh, S could be first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh. This pattern holds for all positions of Q, so S could be in any of the following positions: first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh. We can eliminate options based on this pattern: B) third is eliminated because S can be first or second if Q is second. C) fourth is eliminated because S can be third if Q is second. D) fifth is eliminated because S can be fourth if Q is second. E) sixth is eliminated because S can be fifth if Q is second. Since S could be in any position except first, the correct answer is A) first.</think>\n<ans>A</ans>","ground_truth":"D","predicted_answer":"A","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}
