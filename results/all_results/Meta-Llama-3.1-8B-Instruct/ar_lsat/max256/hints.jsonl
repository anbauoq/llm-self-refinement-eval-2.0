Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings\n\nWhich one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?\nA) The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.\nB) The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.\nC) The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.\nD) The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.\nE) The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.","chain_of_thought":"RealProp owns 1 class 1, 2 class 3s; Southco owns 1 class 1, 1 class 2; Trustcorp owns 3 class 2s.
