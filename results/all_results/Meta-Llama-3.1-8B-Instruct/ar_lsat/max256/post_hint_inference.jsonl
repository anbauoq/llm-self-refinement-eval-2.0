Lopez and Megregian cannot review any plays that Jiang reviews. Since exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other, and Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, the two students who review the same play or plays as each other must be either Kramer and O'Neill or two other students. If the two students who review the same play or plays as each other are Kramer and O'Neill, then the only possible combinations for the other two students are Lopez and Megregian, or Lopez and Jiang. If Lopez and Megregian review the same play or plays, then that play must be Tamerlane, because Lopez and Megregian review fewer or more plays than Kramer and O'Neill respectively, so it cannot be Sunset or Undulation. But then Jiang cannot review any play, which is impossible, so Lopez and Megregian must review different plays. Lopez and Jiang also cannot review the same play or plays, because Jiang cannot review any play that Lopez or Megregian review. Therefore the two students who review the same play or plays as each other must be Kramer and O'Neill.

{"id":"ar_lsat_201612_3-G_4_23","question":"Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings\n\nWhich one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?\nA) The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.\nB) The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.\nC) The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.\nD) The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.\nE) The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.","chain_of_thought":"The number of class 1 buildings doesn’t change when a trade occurs. RealProp starts with 2 class 3 buildings and 1 class 1 building, and Southco and Trustcorp start with 1 class 1 building and 2+2=4 class 2 buildings. If the number of class 1 buildings doesn’t change, then RealProp must always have 1 class 1 building. The only option that violates this rule is D, which says Trustcorp has the Flores Tower and the Yates House. The Flores Tower is class 1, and the Yates House is class 3, so this leaves no room for Trustcorp to have its 4 class 2 buildings.","full_output":"<think>The number of class 1 buildings doesn’t change when a trade occurs.
