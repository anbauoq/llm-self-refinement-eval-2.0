If we use 'x' large trucks, then the remaining capacity for the small trucks will be 134 - 15x. Since each small truck can load 7 tons, the number of small trucks needed will be (134 - 15x) / 7. To minimize the total number of trucks, we should use as many large trucks as possible. This means that (134 - 15x) / 7 should be an integer. Let's find the maximum value of 'x' such that (134 - 15x) is divisible by 7. We can do this by trying out different values of 'x' and checking if the result is an integer. If we try x = 7, we get (134 - 105) / 7 = 29 / 7 = 4.14, which is not an integer. If we try x = 8, we get (134 - 120) / 7 = 14 / 7 = 2, which is an integer. Therefore, the maximum value of 'x' is 8.

At the third stop, there were 7 more people on the bus than when Jose initially saw some people on the bus. At the terminal station, there were 15 fewer people on the bus than when Jose initially saw some people on the bus. Therefore, the total change in the number of people is 5 - 2 + 7 - 15 = -5. This means there were 5 fewer people on the bus when Jose got on than when he initially saw some people on the bus. Since there were 5 fewer people on the bus when Jose got on than when he initially saw some people on the bus, the equation is x - 5 = x. We should instead consider the change in the number of people at each stop separately, without subtracting it from the initial number of people.

How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?","chain_of_thought":"The worm climbs 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day, so the net gain is 8 - 3 = 5 inches per day. The hole is 26 inches deep, so the worm needs to climb 26 - 5 = 21 inches to reach the top. The number of days will be the number of inches the worm needs to climb divided by the net gain per day, which is 21 / 5 = 4.2. Since 4.2 days is less than 5 days and the decimal part is less than 0.5, we don't need to round up.

The sum of the ages of the two sons ten years ago was one-third of the father's age ten years ago, so we have the equation 2x-18 = (1/3)(f-10). Now, let's denote the father's present age as 'f'.

If the train were 6 km/hr faster, it would have taken t - 8 hours, so the new speed would be s + 6 and the new time would be t - 8. The distance would still be the same, so we have the equation st = (s + 6)(t - 8). If the train were slower by 6 km/hr, it would have taken t + 12 hours, so the new speed would be s - 6 and the new time would be t + 12. The distance would still be the same, so we have the equation st = (s - 6)(t + 12). Expanding the first equation gives st = st - 8s + 6t - 48. Expanding the second equation gives st = st + 12s - 6t - 72. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation gives 0 = 20s - 54t - 120. Rearranging the equation gives 20s = 54t + 120. Now, we can express s in terms of t: s = (54t + 120) / 20 = 27t / 10 + 6. Substituting this expression for s into the equation d = st gives d = ((27t / 10) + 6)t. Since we want to find the length of the journey, we can substitute this expression for d into the equation d = st: ((27t / 10) + 6)t = st. Expanding the left side of the equation gives 27t^2 / 10 + 6t = st. Since we know that d = st, we can substitute this expression for d into the equation: 27t^2 / 10 + 6t = st. We can now substitute s = 27t / 10 + 6 into the equation: 27t^2 / 10 + 6t = t(27t / 10 + 6). Multiplying the right side of the equation by t gives 27t^2 / 10 + 6t = 27t^2 / 10 + 6t^2.

We know that d = st, and we are given two equations that relate the train's speed and time: (s + 6)(t - 8) = st and (s - 6)(t + 12) = st. We can rewrite the first equation as st - 8s + 6t - 48 = st.

Since S is a multiple of 13, we can write S = 13m, where m is a positive integer. Substituting S = 13m into the equation S + P = S + 14n, we get 13m + 14n = 13m + 14n. However, this is not helpful as it does not give us any information. Let's try another approach. We know that the number of sparrows is a multiple of 13, so S = 13m. We are also given that the total number of sparrows and parrots is the same, so S + P = S + 14n. Since S = 13m, we can substitute this into the equation S + P = S + 14n to get 13m + 14n = 13m + 14n. However, this is still not helpful. Let's try to find the least common multiple of 13 and 14. The least common multiple of 13 and 14 is 182. Since S is a multiple of 13, we can write S = 13m. Since the total number of sparrows and parrots is the same, we can write S + P = 182. Since P is a multiple of 14, we can write P = 14n. Substituting S = 13m and P = 14n into the equation S + P = 182, we get 13m + 14n = 182. Since 13 and 14 are relatively prime, we can find the smallest solution to this equation by setting m = 14 and n = 13, so S = 13 * 14 = 182 and P = 14 * 13 = 182.

Since the number of sparrows is a multiple of 13, we can set S = 13m. The total number of sparrows and parrots is the same, so S + P = 182. Since P is a multiple of 14, we can write P = 14n.

Here is the correct solution.\n\n<think>Betty has an unknown number of packages of crackers. Each package has 18 crackers. To determine the number of packages, we can divide the total number of crackers she had by the number of crackers per package, 18. However, this will give us the number of whole packages. Since we need to account for any partial packages, we should round down the result of the division. This is because we can't have a fraction of a package. So, the number of whole packages is 45 // 18 = 2. Now, to find the total number of crackers in these whole packages, we multiply the number of whole packages by the number of crackers per package, 2 * 18 = 36. Since Betty ate 45 crackers, to find out how many crackers she has left, we need to account for the partial package. The remainder when 45 is divided by 18 is 9, which means the partial package has 9 crackers. To find the total number of crackers she has left, we subtract the number of crackers she ate from the total number of crackers in the whole packages plus the number of crackers in the partial package, 36 + 9 = 45. However, this is still the same as the original number of crackers she had. Therefore, we can subtract the number of crackers she ate from the total number of crackers in the whole packages, 36 - 45 = -9. However, this is still a negative number. Therefore, we can add the number of crackers in the partial package to the number of whole packages and subtract the number of crackers she ate, 36 + 9 - 45 = 0. However, this is still not correct. Therefore, we can add the number of crackers in the partial package to the number of whole packages and subtract the number of crackers she ate, but we need to account for the fact that the partial package is not a full package. We can do this by subtracting the number of crackers she ate from the total number of crackers in the whole packages plus the number of crackers in the partial package minus the number of crackers in a full package, 36 + 9 - 18 = 27. Since Betty ate 45 crackers, to find out how many crackers she has left, we subtract the number of crackers she ate from the total number of crackers in the whole packages plus the number of crackers in the partial package minus the number of crackers in a full package, 27 - 45 = -18. However, this is still a negative number. Therefore, we can add the number of crackers in the partial package to the number of whole packages and subtract the number of crackers she ate, but we need to account for the fact that the partial package is not a full package and that we have a negative number.

This is because we can't have a fraction of a package. So, the number of whole packages is 45 // 18 = 2. Now, to find the total number of crackers in these whole packages, we multiply the number of whole packages by the number of crackers per package, 2 * 18 = 36. Since Betty ate 45 crackers, to find out how many crackers she has left, we subtract the number of crackers she ate from the total number of crackers in the whole packages, 36 - 45 = -9. Since we can't have a negative number of crackers, this means she must have had at least one partial package. So we add the number of crackers in one package to -9, 18 - 9 = 9. However, this is still less than 45. Therefore, she must have had more than one partial package. We can calculate the number of crackers in the partial package by subtracting the number of crackers in the whole packages from 45, 45 - 36 = 9. Since we've already accounted for 36 crackers, we can subtract 9 from the number of crackers per package to find the number of crackers in the partial package, 18 - 9 = 9.

However, this is still a negative number.
