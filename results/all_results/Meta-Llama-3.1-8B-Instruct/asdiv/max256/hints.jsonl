To do this, we divide the total length of the ribbon by the length of each piece: 3730 / 73 = 51.08. Since we can't have a fraction of a piece, we round down to 51 pieces. Then, we multiply the number of pieces by the length of each piece to find the total length used: 51 * 73 = 3733. Finally, we subtract this from the original length to find out how much is left: 3730 - 3733 = -3. However, since we can't have a negative length, this means that the original length of the ribbon was not enough to make 51 pieces of 73 cm each. So we need to find the largest number of pieces that can be made, which is 51. We know that 51 * 73 = 3733, which is more than the original length.

The point is that 53 / 6 is not an integer, but 53 / 6 = 8 + 5 / 6. The 5 / 6 is the remainder of the division. If we consider the 6 seeds as a whole, then the number of small gardens is 8 and the 5 / 6 is the remainder of the division.

She started with 100 seeds and she will plant the rest in the small gardens. The remaining seeds are 100 - 47 = 53. She planted 6 seeds in each small garden, so she has 53 / 6 = 8.833. Since you can't have a fraction of a garden, she must have 8 small gardens with 6 seeds in each and 5 seeds left over. However, this is not the answer we are looking for. The number of small gardens must be an integer. The 5 seeds left over are not planted in a small garden, they must be planted in the big garden, but that's not the point.

This means the correct answer should be the total number of boxes (45) divided by the number of boxes per case (12), which results in a fraction. Since you can't have a fraction of a case, you need to round up to the nearest whole number. The correct number of full cases is 3 with 9 extra boxes.","full_output":"<think>Nancy sold 45 boxes of Tagalongs. Each case has 12 boxes, so the number of cases needed is 45 / 12 = 3.75. Since you can't have a fraction of a case, she needs 4 cases. This accounts for 48 boxes. The remaining boxes are 45 - 48 = -3. But since you can't have a negative number of boxes, this is a problem with the question. However, if we assume the question is asking for the number of full cases needed and the remaining boxes, we can proceed with the calculation. The remaining boxes are 45 - 48 = -3. Since you can't have a negative number of boxes, we will assume the question is asking for the number of full cases and then the number of remaining boxes.
