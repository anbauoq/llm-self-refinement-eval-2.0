However, since we can't have a negative number of marbles, the problem statement seems to be inconsistent or there might be an error in the interpretation. Assuming the question is asking for the number of marbles remaining after taking out 2 marbles, and then 2 more marbles are taken out, the correct interpretation would be that the 2 marbles taken out the first time are added back into the basket before taking out the second 2 marbles. In this case, there are 2 marbles taken out the first time, which are then added back, and then 2 more marbles are taken out. The correct number of marbles taken out is 2 + 2 = 4.

The sum of the digits is 9, so a + b = 9. Reversing the number gives 10b + a. Nine times the original number is 9(10a + b) = 90a + 9b.

Since each pack likely contains the same number of pencils, let's assume each pack has 'x' number of pencils. Then the number of pencils she has is 18x. Now, she needs to buy the same number of pens, which is 18x. Since she's buying packs of pens, we need to find the smallest number of packs of pens that would give her at least 18x pens. This would be the ceiling of 18x/14, since each pack of pens has 14 pens. The smallest number of packs of pens she needs to buy is the ceiling of (18x/14). Since we are not given the number of pencils in each pack, we assume each pack has 1 pencil (x=1), then the number of packs of pens she needs to buy is the ceiling of 18/14 = 1.2867. Since you can't buy a fraction of a pack, the smallest number of packs of pens she needs to buy is 2.</think>\n<ans>2</ans>","ground_truth":"126","predicted_answer":"2","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}
