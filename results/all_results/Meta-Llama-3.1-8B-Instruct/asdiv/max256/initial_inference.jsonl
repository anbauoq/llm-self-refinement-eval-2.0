The sum of the two digits is 9, so x + y = 9. When the digits are reversed, the new number is 10y + x. The problem states that the new number is increased by 9, so we can write the equation (10y + x) - (10x + y) = 9. Simplifying this equation gives us 9y - 9x = 9, or y - x = 1. We now have two equations: x + y = 9 and y - x = 1. Adding these two equations gives us 2y = 10, so y = 5. Substituting this value of y into the equation x + y = 9 gives us x + 5 = 9, so x = 4.
