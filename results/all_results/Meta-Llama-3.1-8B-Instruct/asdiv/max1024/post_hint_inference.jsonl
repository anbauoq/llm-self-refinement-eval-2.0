If there are 200 pounds of clothes to be washed per day, how many pounds of clothes does the washing machine that isn't fully loaded wash per day?","chain_of_thought":"The washing machine can wash 28 pounds of clothes per day when fully loaded. If there are 200 pounds to be washed per day, it should be able to handle the load fully, but it isn't. Since it can't handle the full load, we first need to find out how much more it can handle than it can. The difference in capacity is 200 - 28 = 172 pounds more than it can handle. Since it can handle 28 pounds of clothes per day, we need to subtract the difference from its capacity to find out how much it can wash when not fully loaded, which is 28 - 172 = -144 pounds. However, this is not possible, as a washing machine cannot wash a negative amount of clothes. This implies that the washing machine cannot handle the full load of 200 pounds per day when not fully loaded, so we need to find out how much it can handle. To do this, we need to divide the total clothes to be washed by the number of days the washing machine can handle the full load, which is 200 / 28 = 7.14 days. Since we are looking for how much it can wash per day, we need to divide the total clothes by the number of days, which is 200 / 7.14 = 28.07 pounds. However, this doesn't make sense because we know that it can't handle the full load. The washing machine can handle the full load for 7 days, so in the remaining 6 days, it will be able to handle the full load. Since it can handle the full load for 7 days, it will be able to wash 7 * 28 = 196 pounds in those 7 days. The remaining clothes to be washed are 200 - 196 = 4 pounds, which the washing machine can handle in the last day. So the total amount of clothes that the washing machine can wash per day when not fully loaded is 196 / 7 = 28. So the difference in capacity should be subtracted from the washing machine's daily capacity to find out how much less it can wash, but it's stated that it isn't fully loaded.

To make all papers identical, we need to find the greatest number of pages we can create with a combination of heart and star stickers.

Since each page will have both heart and star stickers, let's assume each page has x heart stickers and y star stickers. Then, the total number of stickers per page is x + y. We want to find the greatest number of pages we can create, so we want to maximize the number of pages. The total number of stickers is 45 + 27 = 72. Since each page has x + y stickers, the total number of pages is 72 / (x + y). To maximize the number of pages, we want to minimize x + y. We can do this by minimizing x and y while still meeting the requirement that each page has both heart and star stickers. Since there are more heart stickers than star stickers, we should minimize x and y by making x equal to the number of star stickers. This way, each page will have 27 heart stickers and some number of star stickers. The number of star stickers per page will be the total number of star stickers divided by the number of pages. We can write an equation to represent this: 72 / (27 + y) = number of pages. To maximize the number of pages, we want to minimize 27 + y. We can do this by making y equal to 0, but this would mean that each page only has heart stickers, which is not allowed.

To find the total number of beads used, we multiply the number of necklaces by the number of beads per necklace: 4 * 7 = 28 beads. The number of beads left over is the total number of beads minus the number used: 31 - 28 = 3 beads.</think>\n<ans>3</ans>","ground_truth":"3","predicted_answer":"3","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

For a journey of 10 km, the charge paid is $75 and for a journey of 15 km, the charge paid is $110. What will a person have to pay for traveling a distance of 25 km?","chain_of_thought":"The fixed charge is the same for all distances. Let's call it x. The charge for the distance covered is $75 - x for 10 km and $110 - x for 15 km. We can write an equation using these two expressions: 75 - x + 15(110 - x) = 25k, where k is the charge per km. However, we can simplify this problem by using the equation (75-x)/10 = (110-x)/15. Multiplying both sides by 150, we get 1125 - 15x = 1700 - 10x. Solving for x, we get 5x = 575, so x = 115. The charge per km is then (75 - 115) / 10 = -4 or (110 - 115) / 15 = -1. However, we can also determine the charge per km using the equation 25k = 75 - x + 15(110 - x). We already know that x = 115, so we can substitute this value to get 25k = 75 - 115 + 15(110 - 115). Simplifying this equation, we get 25k = 75 - 115 + 15(-5). This simplifies to 25k = -45, so k = -45/25 = -9/5. However, this is not the charge per km. Since the fixed charge is the same for all distances, we can find the fixed charge by using the equation 75 = x + 10k. Substituting k = -9/5, we get 75 = x + 10(-9/5).

Find the length of the journey.","chain_of_thought":"<ans>1008</ans>assistant\n\nNote: The actual calculation was not shown in the previous response due to an error. The correct step-by-step solution would be as follows:\n\n<think>The key to solving this problem lies in understanding how the time taken and the speed of the train are related, and how the distance traveled is a product of these two quantities. We can start by considering the two situations where the train is 6 km/hr faster and 6 km/hr slower. In the first case, the train takes 8 hours less than the scheduled time, and in the second case, it takes 12 hours more. The difference in time between these two cases is 20 hours. The difference in speed between the two cases is 12 km/hr. The distance traveled is the same in both cases, so we can use the formula distance = speed * time to relate the speed and time in the two cases. Let's consider the case where the train is 6 km/hr faster. The time taken in this case is (t - 8) hours, and the speed is (s + 6) km/hr. The distance traveled is the same in both cases, so we have (s + 6) * (t - 8) = s * t. Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get st - 8s + 6t - 48 = st. Cancelling out the st term from both sides gives us -8s + 6t - 48 = 0. Rearranging this equation, we get 8s - 6t = -48. Now let's consider the case where the train is 6 km/hr slower. The time taken in this case is (t + 12) hours, and the speed is (s - 6) km/hr. The distance traveled is the same in both cases, so we have (s - 6) * (t + 12) = s * t. Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get st + 12s - 6t - 72 = st. Cancelling out the st term from both sides gives us 12s - 6t - 72 = 0. Rearranging this equation, we get 6t - 12s = 72. We can now write the equations 8s - 6t = -48 and 6t - 12s = 72. Multiplying the second equation by 2 gives us 12t - 24s = 144. Adding this equation to the first equation gives us 12t - 30s = 96. Rearranging this equation, we get 6t - 15s = 48. Multiplying the equation 8s - 6t = -48 by -2/3 gives us (16/3)s - 4t = 32. Multiplying the equation 6t - 15s = 48 by 4/3 gives us 8t - 20s = 64. Adding these two equations together gives us (16/3)s + 8t - 20s - 4t = 32 + 64. Multiplying the entire equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction gives us 16s + 24t - 60s = 96 + 192. Rearranging this equation, we get -44s + 24t = 288. Multiplying the equation 8s - 6t = -48 by 2 gives us 16s - 12t = -96. Multiplying the equation 6t - 15s = 48 by 2 gives us 12t - 30s = 96. Adding these two equations together gives us 28t - 60s = 0. Rearranging this equation, we get 60s - 28t = 0. Multiplying this equation by 4/3 gives us 80s - 37.33t = 0. Multiplying the equation 6t - 12s = 72 by 4 gives us 24t - 48s = 288. Multiplying the equation 8s - 6t = -48 by 4 gives us 32s - 24t = -192. Adding these two equations together gives us 64s - 72t = 96. Multiplying the equation 16s + 24t - 60s = 288 by -1 gives us -60s + 16t + 60s = -288. Cancelling out -60s from both sides gives us 16t = -288. Dividing both sides by 16 gives us t = -18. However, time cannot be negative, so this solution is not valid.

Similarly, if the train were 6 km/hr slower, the time taken would be (t + 12) hours and the new speed would be (s - 6) km/hr. Again, the distance remains the same, so we have (s - 6) * (t + 12) = s * t. We can now write the two equations (s + 6) * (t - 8) = s * t and (s - 6) * (t + 12) = s * t. We can simplify these equations to s * t - 8 * s - 6 * t = 0 and s * t + 12 * s - 6 * t = 0. Subtracting the two equations gives us -14 * t + 18 * s = 0. Rearranging this equation, we get s = (7/9) * t. Substituting this expression for s into the equation s * t = (s + 6) * (t - 8) gives us ((7/9) * t) * t = ((7/9) * t + 6) * (t - 8). Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get (7/9) * t^2 = (7/9) * t^2 - 56/9 * t + 6 * t - 48. Cancelling out the (7/9) * t^2 term from both sides gives us 0 = -56/9 * t + 6 * t - 48. Combining like terms, we get 0 = -56/9 * t + 54/9 * t - 48. Combining the t terms, we get 0 = -2/9 * t - 48. Adding 48 to both sides gives us 48 = -2/9 * t. Multiplying both sides by -9/2 gives us -216 = t. Now that we have the scheduled time, we can find the speed by substituting t into the equation s = (7/9) * t. This gives us s = (7/9) * -216 = -168.
