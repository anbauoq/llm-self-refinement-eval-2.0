The perimeter is the sum of all sides. Since the postcard is 6 inches wide, we can assume it is a rectangle. Let the height be h. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width. We are given that P = 20 and w = 6. Plugging in these values, we get 20 = 2l + 2(6). This simplifies to 20 = 2l + 12. Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get 8 = 2l. Dividing both sides by 2, we get 4 = l. Now we can find the height using the Pythagorean theorem, h^2 = l^2 - w^2.

{"id":1823,"question":"A florist needed to use 2 pounds of fertilizer for 9 days and then on the final day use the normal amount plus another 4 pounds. How many pounds of fertilizer will she use all together?","chain_of_thought":"She uses 2 pounds of fertilizer for 9 days. That means each day she uses 2 / 9 pounds of fertilizer. On the final day, she uses the normal amount plus 4 pounds. The normal amount is 2 / 9 pounds, and she adds 4 pounds, so she uses 2 / 9 + 4 pounds on the final day. To add these two amounts, we need to get a common denominator, which is 9. So we can rewrite 4 as 36 / 9. Now we can add them: 2 / 9 + 36 / 9 = 38 / 9. To find the total amount of fertilizer used, we need to multiply the amount used for 9 days by 9 and add the amount used on the final day. The amount used for 9 days is 2 pounds, so for 9 days it's 2 * 9 = 18 pounds. Now we add the amount used on the final day, which is 38 / 9 pounds. To add these two amounts, we need to get a common denominator, which is 9. So we can rewrite 18 as 162 / 9. Now we can add them: 162 / 9 + 38 / 9 = 200 / 9. Now we can convert this improper fraction to a decimal: 200 / 9 = 22.22. Now we multiply the amount used for 9 days by 9: 2 * 9 = 18. Now we add the amount used on the final day to the amount used for 9 days: 18 + 38 / 9 = 18 + 4.22 = 22.22. Now we multiply 22.22 by 9: 22.22 * 9 = 200. So the total amount of fertilizer used is 2 * 9 + 38 / 9 * 9 = 200 pounds.","full_output":"<think>She uses 2 pounds of fertilizer for 9 days. That means each day she uses 2 / 9 pounds of fertilizer.

Now we can convert this improper fraction to a mixed number: 200 / 9 = 22 2/9. To convert this mixed number to a decimal, we need to divide the numerator by the denominator: 2/9 = 0.22. Now we can add 22 and 0.22: 22 + 0.22 = 22.22. To convert this decimal to an improper fraction, we need to multiply the denominator by the decimal part and add it to the numerator: 22.22 = 200.22 / 9. Now we can multiply the numerator by 9 to get rid of the decimal: 200.22 * 9 = 1801.98. Now we can convert this improper fraction to a mixed number: 1801.98 = 200 1/9. To convert this mixed number to an improper fraction, we need to multiply the denominator by the decimal part and add it to the numerator: 200 1/9 = 1802 / 9. Now we can convert this improper fraction to a decimal: 1802 / 9 = 200.22. Now\n\n<think>She uses 2 pounds of fertilizer for 9 days. That means each day she uses 2 / 9 pounds of fertilizer.
