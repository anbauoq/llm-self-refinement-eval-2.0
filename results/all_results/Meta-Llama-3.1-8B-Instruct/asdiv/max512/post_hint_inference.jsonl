We can do this by factoring each number into its prime factors: 15 = 3 * 5 and 16 = 2^4. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all the prime factors: LCM = 2^4 * 3 * 5 = 240. This means that the least number of packs of each type needed is 240 / 15 = 16 packs of tulips and 240 / 16 = 15 packs of daffodils. However, the question asks for the least number of each type of bulb, not the least number of packs. Since each pack contains 15 tulip bulbs and 16 daffodil bulbs, we can calculate the least number of each type of bulb by multiplying the number of packs by the number of bulbs per pack: 16 packs * 15 tulips/pack = 240 tulips and 15 packs * 16 daffodils/pack = 240 daffodils. Since the problem asks for the least number of each type of bulb, we should find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 15 and 16 to find the least common multiple of the number of bulbs in each pack, then multiply this by the LCM of 15 and 16 to get the least number of each type of bulb. However, the problem asks for the least number of each type of bulb, not the least common multiple of the number of bulbs in each pack. Since the LCM of the pack sizes is 240, the least number of each type of bulb is simply 240 / 15 = 16 for tulips and 240 / 16 = 15 for daffodils. However, we are looking for the least number of each type of bulb. Since 15 and 16 are relatively prime, the least number of each type of bulb is simply 240 / 15 = 16 for tulips and 240 / 16 = 15 for daffodils. However, we are looking for the least number of each type of bulb, not the least number of packs. Since the LCM of the pack sizes is 240, the least number of each type of bulb is 240 / GCD(15,16).

To find the smallest number of slices of each type that Randy could have bought, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 28. The LCM of 12 and 28 can be found by first breaking them down into their prime factors: 12 = 2^2 * 3 and 28 = 2^2 * 7. The LCM will contain the highest power of each prime factor, so LCM = 2^2 * 3 * 7 = 84. However, the common number of slices may not be the LCM itself but a factor of it. We can find the factors of 84: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84. We can see that 84 is divisible by both 12 and 28. Therefore, the smallest number of slices of each type that Randy could have bought is 84 / 12 = 7 slices of cheddar cheese and 84 / 28 = 3 slices of Swiss cheese. However, the question asks for the number of slices of each type. The smallest number of slices of cheddar cheese is 7 and the smallest number of slices of Swiss cheese is 3.
