We have the following system of equations: A + B + C = 24, A + B = 11, B + C = 18. We can simplify the first equation by subtracting the second from it, which results in C - B = 13. Adding the last two equations together results in 2A + 2C = 29. Dividing by 2 gives A + C = 14.5. Since A and C must be whole numbers (you can't have half of an apple), we can subtract 0.5 from A + C to find that A and C must be 7 and 7.5. But again, you can't have half of an apple. However, if we go back to the equation A + B + C = 24 and A + C = 14.5, we can subtract the last equation from the first to find B = 9.5. But again, you can't have half of an apple. However, we can see that if we add 0.5 to the first equation A + B + C = 24 and the equation A + C = 14.5, we get B = 9.5. But again, you can't have half of an apple. However, if we go back to the equation A + C = 14.5, we can add 0.5 to both sides of the equation A + C = 14.5 to get A + C = 15. This means that A and C are 7 and 8, or vice versa.

To do this, we first need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 96, 144, and 224, since each platter must have the same number of each part. We can use prime factorization to find the GCD. The prime factorization of 96 is 2^5 * 3, of 144 is 2^4 * 3^2, and of 224 is 2^5 * 7. The common factors are 2^4, so the GCD is 2^4 = 16. This means each platter can have 16 chicken legs, 16 thighs, and 16 wings. To find the number of platters, we divide each total by 16. The number of platters is 96 / 16 = 6, 144 / 16 = 9, and 224 / 16 = 14. The smallest number of platters is 6, so the staff can make 6 platters with the greatest number of chicken pieces on each platter.</think>\n<ans>6</ans>","ground_truth":"16","predicted_answer":"6","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false,"hint_sentence":"When finding the greatest number of platters, you should be looking for the least common multiple (LCM) of the quantities of chicken pieces, rather than the greatest common divisor (GCD)."}

According to the problem, x/3 + x/5 = 8/15 * x. To simplify this, we need to find the common denominator for 3 and 5, which is 15. So we multiply the first fraction by 5/5 and the second fraction by 3/3 to get 5x/15 + 3x/15 = 8x/15. This simplifies to 8x/15. Now we can set up the equation x/3 + x/5 = 8x/15.

The minimum number of packages each must have shipped is a multiple of 198. We can express the number of packages that Sarah and Ryan must have shipped as 18x and 11x respectively, where x is an integer. To find the minimum number of packages, we need to find the smallest x that satisfies the condition. Since 18x and 11x must be equal, we can set up the equation 18x = 11x and solve for x. However, this equation has no solution because 18 is not equal to 11. Therefore, we need to find the smallest x that satisfies the condition 18x = 11y, where y is an integer. This can be rewritten as 18x = 11(18x/11), which simplifies to 18x = 18x. This equation has infinitely many solutions, but we can find the smallest x by setting x = 22. Then, 18x = 18(22) = 396, and 11x = 11(22) = 242. However, 242 is not equal to 396. Therefore, we need to find the next multiple of 11 that is greater than 396. The next multiple of 11 is 418, and the next multiple of 18 is 396. However, 396 is less than 418, so we need to find the next multiple of 18 that is greater than 418.

The next multiple of 11 is 462, and the next multiple of 18 is 459. However, 459 is less than 462, so we need to find the next multiple of 18 that is greater than 462. The next multiple of 18 is 459, and the next multiple of 11 is 462. Since 462 is greater than 459, we can set x = 3744/22 = 170. 18x = 18(3744/22) = 3744, and 11x = 11(3744/22) = 3744.

The highest power of 2 in 6480 is 2^4, the highest power of 3 is 3^2, and the highest power of 5 is 5. Therefore, the largest possible side length for each square is 2^4 * 3^2 * 5 = 720 / (2^4 * 3^2) = 5.</think>\n<ans>5</ans>","ground_truth":"18","predicted_answer":"5","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false,"hint_sentence":"When finding the largest possible side length for each square, consider how the side length relates to the total area of the board, and think about how the area of each square contributes to the overall area being covered."}
