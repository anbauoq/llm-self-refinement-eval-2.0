Each day, a different antique is auctioned: harmonica (H), lamp (L), mirror (M), sundial (S), table (T), and vase (V).\n\nThe conditions are:\n\n1. S is not auctioned on June 1st, so S is on days 2-6.\n2. If H is auctioned before L, then M is also auctioned before L.\n3. S is auctioned before both M and V.\n4. T is auctioned before H or before V, but not both.\n\nWe need to find out which item cannot be immediately before V.\n\nLet me try to map out the possible positions.\n\nSince S is not on June 1st, let's assume S is on June 2nd. Then, M and V must be after June 2nd. So M can be on days 3, 4, 5, or 6, and V must be after day 2.\n\nCondition 2 says that if H is before L, then M is also before L. So H < L implies","predicted_answer":null,"ground_truth":"A","is_correct":null,"was_retried":true}
{"id":"ar_lsat_201612_3-G_3_17","question":"At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.\n\nWhich one of the following could be true?\nA) Both of Franz's paintings and both of Greene's paintings are displayed in lower positions.\nB) Both of Franz's paintings and both of Greene's paintings are displayed in upper positions.\nC) Both of Franz's paintings and both of Hidalgo's paintings are displayed in upper positions.\nD) Both of Greene's paintings and both of Hidalgo's paintings are displayed in lower positions.\nE) Both of Greene's paintings and both of Hidalgo's paintings are displayed in upper positions.","chain_of_thought":"Alright, let me try to work through this problem step by step. So, we have four walls, each with an upper and lower slot, making eight slots in total. Each wall must have exactly two paintings, and each painting is either an oil or a watercolor. There are four students: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs, each displaying exactly one oil and one watercolor.\n\nFirst, let's note down all the constraints:\n\n1. **No wall has only watercolors.** So each wall must have at least one oil painting.\n\n2. **No wall has only one student's work.** This means each wall must have two different students.\n\n3. **Franz and Isaacs cannot be on the same wall.**\n\n4. **Greene's watercolor is in the upper position of the wall where Franz's oil is.**\n\n5. **Isaacs's oil is in the lower position of wall 4.**\n\nOur goal is to figure out which of the options (A to E) could be true based on these constraints.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the fourth condition: Greene's watercolor is in the upper position of the wall where Franz's oil is.

Isaacs's oil is in the lower position of wall 4.\n\nFirst, let's note that each wall must have one oil and one watercolor because no wall can have only watercolors (since each student has one oil and one watercolor, and each wall has two paintings). So each wall must have one oil and one watercolor.\n\nNext, each student has exactly one oil and one watercolor. So, each student contributes one oil and one watercolor to the exhibition.\n\nNow, let's consider the fourth condition: Greene's watercolor is in the upper position of the wall where Franz's oil is.
