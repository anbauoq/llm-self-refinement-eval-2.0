The problem says, \"If the pilot flies the same number of miles 3 weeks in a row, how many miles does he fly in all?\" So, it's not that he flies the same number each day, but that he flies the same total miles each week for three weeks.\n\nBut that doesn't make sense either because the total miles per week would vary if he flies different amounts on different days. However, the problem states that he flies the same number of miles each day for three weeks in a row.

But that doesn't add up because he can't fly two different amounts on different days if he's flying the same number each day.\n\nI'm clearly misunderstanding something. Let's try to approach it differently. Maybe the pilot flies a total of 1,134 + 1,475 miles in the first week, which is 2,609 miles. Then, if he flies the same number of miles each week for three weeks, the total would be 2,609 * 3 = 7,827 miles. But the hint says to consider all five days, so perhaps the total per week is more than that.\n\nWait, maybe the pilot flies the same number of miles each day, not the same total each week. So, in the first week, he flew 1,134 on Tuesday and 1,475 on Thursday, which are two different days. If he flies the same number of miles each day, then on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, he must have flown the same amount as on Tuesday and Thursday.\n\nBut that would mean he flew 1,134 miles on Monday, 1,475 on Wednesday, and 1,134 on Friday, which doesn't make sense because the numbers are inconsistent.

{"id":733,"question":"A bus can transport 48 passengers. If a school of 1,230 students and teachers are going on a field trip, how many passengers are there on the bus that is not fully occupied?","chain_of_thought":"Alright, so I have this problem here about a bus transporting passengers. Let me try to figure it out step by step.\n\nFirst, the bus can carry a maximum of 48 passengers. That's clear from the problem. Now, the school has 1,230 students and teachers going on a field trip. I need to find out how many passengers are on the bus that's not fully occupied. Basically, how many seats are left empty.\n\nOkay, so the total number of people going on the trip is 1,230. The bus can take 48 passengers at a time. I think I need to figure out how many full buses are needed to transport all the students and teachers. Then, since each bus can only carry 48, the number of passengers on each bus that's not fully occupied would be the total number of people minus the number of buses times 48.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If each bus can take 48, how many buses are needed for 1,230 people? I can calculate that by dividing the total number by the bus capacity. So, 1,230 divided by 48. Let me do that.\n\n1,230 ÷ 48. Hmm, 48 times 25 is 1,200, right? Because 48 times 20 is 960, and 48 times 5 is 240, so 960 + 240 is 1,200. So 25 buses would carry 1,200 people. But we have 1,230, which is 30 more than 1,200. So we need one more bus for those 30. So that would be 26 buses in total.\n\nEach of those 26 buses can take up to 48 passengers. So the first 25 buses are fully occupied with 48 each, carrying 1,200 people. The 26th bus has 30 people. So the number of passengers on that 26th bus is 30, which is less than the maximum of 48. Therefore, the number of unoccupied seats is 48 minus 30, which is 18.\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many passengers are there on the bus that is not fully occupied. So that would be the 26th bus with 30 passengers, and the unoccupied seats are 18. But I think the question is specifically asking for the number of passengers on the bus that's not fully occupied, not the empty seats. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking how many seats are left empty on all the buses combined. But the way the question is phrased is a bit unclear. Let me read it again: \"how many passengers are there on the bus that is not fully occupied?\" So it's referring to a single bus that isn't fully occupied. So if the bus can take 48, and the 26th bus has 30, then on that bus, there are 30 passengers and 18 empty seats. But the question is about the number of passengers, not the empty seats.\n\nWait, no, the question is asking how many passengers are there on the bus that is not fully occupied. So that would be the 30 passengers on the 26th bus. But the problem is, the bus isn't fully occupied because it only has 30 out of 48 seats. So the number of passengers on that bus is 30.\n\nBut the hint says the difference between the number of passengers and 48 gives the unoccupied seats. So maybe the question is actually asking for the number of unoccupied seats, not the passengers on the under-occupied bus. That makes more sense, because the passengers on the under-occupied bus are 30.\n\nSo, the number of unoccupied seats is 48 minus 30, which is 18. Therefore, the number of empty seats is 18.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. It says, \"how many passengers are there on the bus that is not fully occupied?\" If it's referring to the passengers, it's 30. If it's referring to the empty seats, it's 18. The hint mentions the difference between the number of passengers and 48 gives the unoccupied seats, so maybe the answer is 18.\n\nI think the intended answer is the number of empty seats, which is 18. So I'll go with that.","full_output":"Alright, so I have this problem here about a bus transporting passengers.

Therefore, the number of unoccupied seats is 48 minus 30, which is 18.\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many passengers are there on the bus that is not fully occupied. So that would be the 26th bus with 30 passengers, and the unoccupied seats are 18. But I think the question is specifically asking for the number of passengers on the bus that's not fully occupied, not the empty seats. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's asking how many seats are left empty on all the buses combined. But the way the question is phrased is a bit unclear. Let me read it again: \"how many passengers are there on the bus that is not fully occupied?\" So it's referring to a single bus that isn't fully occupied. So if the bus can take 48, and the 26th bus has 30, then on that bus, there are 30 passengers and 18 empty seats. But the question is about the number of passengers, not the empty seats.\n\nWait, no, the question is asking how many passengers are there on the bus that is not fully occupied. So that would be the 30 passengers on the 26th bus. But the problem is, the bus isn't fully occupied because it only has 30 out of 48 seats. So the number of passengers on that bus is 30.\n\nBut the hint says the difference between the number of passengers and 48 gives the unoccupied seats. So maybe the question is actually asking for the number of unoccupied seats, not the passengers on the under-occupied bus. That makes more sense, because the passengers on the under-occupied bus are 30.\n\nSo, the number of unoccupied seats is 48 minus 30, which is 18. Therefore, the number of empty seats is 18.\n\nBut let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. It says, \"how many passengers are there on the bus that is not fully occupied?\" If it's referring to the passengers, it's 30. If it's referring to the empty seats, it's 18. The hint mentions the difference between the number of passengers and 48 gives the unoccupied seats, so maybe the answer is 18.\n\nI think the intended answer is the number of empty seats, which is 18. So I'll go with that.\n</think>\n\nThe bus has a capacity of 48 passengers. To transport 1,230 students and teachers, 26 buses are needed. The first 25 buses are fully occupied, carrying 48 each. The 26th bus carries 30 passengers, leaving 18 seats empty. Therefore, there are 18 unoccupied seats.\n\n\\boxed{18}","ground_truth":"30","predicted_answer":"18","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

The question is asking how old London was several years ago when Blair was twice as old as London.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the age difference between Blair and London. Since Blair is 16 and London is 11, the difference in their ages is 16 - 11 = 5 years. That means Blair is always 5 years older than London.\n\nNow, let's denote the number of years ago when Blair was twice as old as London as 'x' years. At that time, London's age would have been 11 - x years old, and Blair's age would have been 16 - x years old.\n\nAccording to the problem, Blair was twice as old as London at that time. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nBlair's age then = 2 * London's age then\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n16 - x = 2 * (11 - x)\n\nNow, let's solve for x.\n\n16 - x = 22 - 2x\n\nTo isolate x, I'll add 2x to both sides:\n\n16 - x + 2x = 22\n\n16 + x = 22\n\nNext, subtract 16 from both sides:\n\nx = 22 - 16\n\nx = 6\n\nSo, x is 6 years ago.

So, we have London who is currently 11 years old and Blair who is 16 years old. The question is asking how old London was several years ago when Blair was twice as old as London.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the age difference between Blair and London. Since Blair is 16 and London is 11, the difference in their ages is 16 - 11 = 5 years. That means Blair is always 5 years older than London.\n\nNow, let's denote the number of years ago when Blair was twice as old as London as 'x' years. At that time, London's age would have been 11 - x years old, and Blair's age would have been 16 - x years old.\n\nAccording to the problem, Blair was twice as old as London at that time. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nBlair's age then = 2 * London's age then\n\nWhich translates to:\n\n16 - x = 2 * (11 - x)\n\nNow, let's solve for x.\n\n16 - x = 22 - 2x\n\nTo isolate x, I'll add 2x to both sides:\n\n16 - x + 2x = 22\n\n16 + x = 22\n\nNext, subtract 16 from both sides:\n\nx = 22 - 16\n\nx = 6\n\nSo, x is 6 years ago. Now, to find out how old London was at that time, we subtract x from London's current age:\n\nLondon's age then = 11 - x = 11 - 6 = 5\n\nTherefore, London was 5 years old when Blair was twice as old as London.\n\nTo double-check, Blair's age 6 years ago would have been 16 - 6 = 10 years old. Since 10 is twice 5, the equation holds true.\n\nSo, the final answer is that London was 5 years old at that time.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{5}","ground_truth":"6","predicted_answer":"5","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There's a two-digit number, 32. When we subtract an unknown number from 32, the result is a number whose digits are the reverse of 32, which would be 23. So, 32 minus the unknown number equals 23. But wait, the problem says \"a number,\" not necessarily positive. So, the result could also be negative. That means the unknown number could be larger than 32, making the result a negative number. In that case, the reversed digits would be -23.\n\nLet me define the unknown number as \\( x \\). So, according to the problem, either \\( 32 - x = 23 \\) or \\( 32 - x = -23 \\). I need to solve for \\( x \\) in both cases.\n\nStarting with the first case: \\( 32 - x = 23 \\). To find \\( x \\), I can subtract 23 from both sides: \\( 32 - 23 = x \\), which simplifies to \\( x = 9 \\).\n\nNow, the second case: \\( 32 - x = -23 \\). Similarly, I'll add \\( x \\) to both sides and then add 23 to both sides: \\( 32 = x - 23 \\). Adding 23 to both sides gives \\( x = 32 + 23 \\), which is \\( x = 55 \\).\n\nSo, the unknown number could be either 9 or 55. But wait, I should check if both of these make sense in the context of the problem. If \\( x = 9 \\), then \\( 32 - 9 = 23 \\), which is the reverse of 32. That works. If \\( x = 55 \\), then \\( 32 - 55 = -23 \\), which is the negative of the reversed digits. That also works because the problem mentions that the result could be either positive or negative.\n\nTherefore, both 9 and 55 are valid solutions.

Therefore, \\( D = (v - 6)(t + 12) \\).\n\nSince both expressions equal \\( D \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[ (v + 6)(t - 8) = (v - 6)(t + 12) \\]\n\nExpanding both sides:\n\\[ vt - 8v + 6t - 48 = vt + 12v - 6t - 72 \\]\n\nSimplifying by subtracting \\( vt \\) from both sides:\n\\[ -8v + 6t - 48 = 12v - 6t - 72 \\]\n\nCombining like terms:\n\\[ -8v + 6t - 48 - 12v + 6t + 72 = 0 \\]\n\\[ -20v + 12t + 24 = 0 \\]\n\nDividing the entire equation by 4 to simplify:\n\\[ -5v + 3t + 6 = 0 \\]\n\\[ -5v + 3t = -6 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)} \\]\n\nNow, let's consider the original distance expressions:\n\\[ D = v \\times t \\]\n\\[ D = (v + 6)(t - 8) \\]\n\\[ D = (v - 6)(t + 12) \\]\n\nSince all equal \\( D \\), we can set up another equation by equating \\( (v + 6)(t - 8) = (v - 6)(t + 12) \\), which simplifies similarly to Equation 1.\n\nHowever, to find another equation, we can express \\( D \\) in terms of both scenarios:\n1. From \\( D = (v + 6)(t - 8) \\)\n2.

However, with only one equation, it's underdetermined. Therefore, we need to consider the relationship between the two scenarios to find another equation.\n\nLet me consider the time saved and the time lost. When the speed is increased, the time is decreased by 8 hours, and when the speed is decreased, the time is increased by 12 hours. This implies a relationship between the changes in speed and time.\n\nLet me denote the change in speed as \\( \\Delta v = 6 \\) km/h and the change in time as \\( \\Delta t \\). When speed increases, time decreases, and vice versa. The ratio of the changes can be considered.\n\nThe time saved when increasing speed is 8 hours, and the time added when decreasing speed is 12 hours. The total time change is 20 hours (from +8 to +12). However, this might not directly help in setting up the equations.\n\nAlternatively, let's express \\( t \\) in terms of \\( v \\) from Equation 1:\n\\[ -5v + 3t = -6 \\]\n\\[ 3t = 5v - 6 \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{5v - 6}{3} \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( t \\) back into the original distance equation:\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. We have a train journey where the speed and time are inversely related. The problem gives us two scenarios:\n\n1. If the train's speed is increased by 6 km/h, the time taken is 8 hours less than the scheduled time.\n2. If the train's speed is decreased by 6 km/h, the time taken is 12 hours more than the scheduled time.\n\nWe need to find the distance covered in the journey.\n\n**Let's define the variables:**\n- Let \\( v \\) be the original speed of the train in km/h.\n- Let \\( t \\) be the scheduled time in hours.\n- The distance \\( D \\) covered is given by \\( D = v \\times t \\).\n\n**Setting up the equations:**\nFrom the first scenario:\n\\[ D = (v + 6)(t - 8) \\]\nFrom the second scenario:\n\\[ D = (v - 6)(t + 12) \\]\n\nSince both expressions equal \\( D \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[ (v + 6)(t - 8) = (v - 6)(t + 12) \\]\n\n**Expanding both sides:**\n\\[ vt - 8v + 6t - 48 = vt + 12v - 6t - 72 \\]\n\n**Simplifying by subtracting \\( vt \\) from both sides:**\n\\[ -8v + 6t - 48 = 12v - 6t - 72 \\]\n\n**Combining like terms:**\n\\[ -8v + 6t - 48 - 12v + 6t + 72 = 0 \\]\n\\[ -20v + 12t + 24 = 0 \\]\n\n**Simplifying the equation:**\n\\[ -5v + 3t = -6 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)} \\]\n\n**Expressing \\( t \\) in terms of \\( v \\):**\n\\[ 3t = 5v - 6 \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{5v - 6}{3} \\]\n\n**Substituting \\( t \\) back into the original distance equation:**\n\\[ D = v \\times \\left( \\frac{5v - 6}{3} \\right) \\]\n\\[ D = \\frac{5v^2 - 6v}{3} \\]\n\n**Considering the other scenario to find another equation:**\nFrom the second scenario:\n\\[ D = (v - 6)(t + 12) \\]\nSubstituting \\( t \\):\n\\[ D = (v - 6)\\left( \\frac{5v - 6}{3} + 12 \\right) \\]\n\\[ D = (v - 6)\\left( \\frac{5v - 6 + 36}{3} \\right) \\]\n\\[ D = (v - 6)\\left( \\frac{5v + 30}{3} \\right) \\]\n\\[ D = \\frac{(v - 6)(5v + 30)}{3} \\]\n\\[ D = \\frac{5v^2 + 30v - 30v - 180}{3} \\]\n\\[ D = \\frac{5v^2 - 180}{3} \\]\n\n**Equating the two expressions for \\( D \\):**\n\\[ \\frac{5v^2 - 6v}{3} = \\frac{5v^2 - 180}{3} \\]\n\\[ 5v^2 - 6v = 5v^2 - 180 \\]\n\\[ -6v = -180 \\]\n\\[ v = 30 \\]\n\n**Finding \\( t \\):**\n\\[ t = \\frac{5(30) - 6}{3} \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{150 - 6}{3} \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{144}{3} \\]\n\\[ t = 48 \\]\n\n**Calculating the distance \\( D \\):**\n\\[ D = v \\times t \\]\n\\[ D = 30 \\times 48 \\]\n\\[ D = 1440 \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\nThe length of the journey is \\boxed{1440} km.\n</think>\n\nThe length of the journey is \\boxed{1440} km.","ground_truth":"1440","predicted_answer":"1440","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

She found gift bags in packs of 12 and bows in packs of 5. I need to figure out the smallest number of gift bags she needs to buy so that the total number of gift bags equals the total number of bows.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. Gift bags come in packs of 12, so if she buys 'x' packs, she'll have 12x gift bags. Bows come in packs of 5, so if she buys 'y' packs, she'll have 5y bows. Kristen wants these two quantities to be equal, so 12x = 5y.\n\nBut the question is asking for the smallest number of gift bags she needs to buy. That means we need to find the smallest integer value of x such that 12x is equal to some multiple of 5y. In other words, 12x should be a multiple of 5 because 5y is a multiple of 5.\n\nSo, mathematically, we can express this as 12x = 5y.

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. Since 12 and 5 are coprime (they have no common divisors other than 1), their LCM is just their product.\n\nSo, LCM of 12 and 5 is 12 * 5 = 60.

They need to be shared equally among the students, and each student should get the same number of whole cookies and whole pizza slices with nothing left over. The question is asking for the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices each student can get.\n\nHmm, so we need to find the maximum number of students such that each student gets an equal number of cookies and pizza slices without any leftovers. That means the number of students has to be a common divisor of both 20 and 40. Because if the number of students divides both 20 and 40 evenly, then each student will get a whole number of cookies and pizza slices.\n\nLet me recall what a common divisor is. A common divisor of two numbers is a number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. So, for 20 and 40, their common divisors are the numbers that can divide both evenly.\n\nFirst, let's list the divisors of 20. The divisors of 20 are 1, 2, 4, 5, and 10, 20. Wait, actually, 20 is 2^2 * 5, so its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.\n\nNow, for 40, let's list its divisors. 40 is 2^3 * 5, so its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40.\n\nSo the common divisors of 20 and 40 are the numbers that appear in both lists. Looking at the two lists:\n\n20's divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20\n\n40's divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40\n\nThe common ones are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20.\n\nSo those are the possible numbers of students. Now, the question is asking for the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices each student can get. That would mean we need the largest number of students possible where each student gets the same whole number of both items.\n\nSo, among the common divisors, the largest is 20. So, if there are 20 students, each student would get 20/20 = 1 cookie and 40/20 = 2 pizza slices. That works because 1 and 2 are whole numbers, and there are no leftovers.\n\nWait, but the hint says something about the largest common divisor being 5. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding something here. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the hint says, \"The largest such number is 5, which ensures each student gets the same whole number of both items without leftovers.\" But according to my calculation, 20 is a common divisor, and it's larger than 5. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nHold on, perhaps the problem is that the number of students can't exceed the number of cookies or pizza slices. Wait, no, because the number of students is the divisor, and the number of cookies per student is 20 divided by the number of students, and the pizza per student is 40 divided by the number of students.\n\nSo, if we take 20 students, each would get 1 cookie and 2 pizza slices. That seems fine because 1 and 2 are whole numbers, and 20 and 40 are both divisible by 20.\n\nBut the hint suggests 5 as the largest number. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.

So, the board can be completely covered with 4 columns and 5 rows of 18 cm squares.\n\nIs there a larger square possible? Well, if I try 36 cm, which is half of 72, but 36 doesn't divide 90 evenly because 90 divided by 36 is 2.5, which isn't a whole number. So, 36 cm squares won't fit properly along the 90 cm side.

{"id":1798,"question":"Two wires with lengths of 448 cm and 616 cm are to be cut into pieces of all the same length without remainder. What is the greatest possible length of the pieces?","chain_of_thought":"Alright, so I have this problem here about two wires with lengths 448 cm and 616 cm, and I need to figure out the greatest possible length of pieces that can be cut from them without any remainder. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst off, I remember that when you want to cut pieces from two different lengths and all pieces have to be the same length, the maximum possible length is determined by the greatest common divisor (GCD) of those two lengths. The GCD is the largest number that can divide both 448 and 616 exactly, without leaving any remainder. So, if I can find the GCD of 448 and 616, that should give me the answer.\n\nAlright, so how do I find the GCD? I recall that the Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for this. It involves dividing the larger number by the smaller one and then using the remainder to continue the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.\n\nLet me write down the numbers: 616 and 448. Since 616 is larger than 448, I'll start with 616 divided by 448.\n\nCalculating 616 ÷ 448: 448 goes into 616 once, with a remainder. Let me do the division.\n\n448 * 1 = 448. Subtracting that from 616 gives 616 - 448 = 168. So, the remainder is 168.\n\nNow, according to the Euclidean algorithm, I take the previous divisor (448) and divide it by the remainder (168).\n\nSo, 448 ÷ 168. Let's see how many times 168 goes into 448.\n\n168 * 2 = 336. Subtracting that from 448 gives 448 - 336 = 112. So, the remainder is 112.\n\nNext step: take the last divisor (168) and divide by the remainder (112).\n\n168 ÷ 112. 112 goes into 168 once, with a remainder. 112 * 1 = 112. Subtracting gives 168 - 112 = 56. So, the remainder is 56.\n\nContinuing, take the last divisor (112) and divide by the remainder (56).\n\n112 ÷ 56 = 2 exactly, with no remainder. Since we've reached a remainder of zero, the last non-zero remainder is 56. Therefore, the GCD of 448 and 616 is 56.\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 616 and 448:\n\n1. 616 ÷ 448 = 1 with remainder 168.\n2. 448 ÷ 168 = 2 with remainder 112.\n3. 168 ÷ 112 = 1 with remainder 56.\n4. 112 ÷ 56 = 2 with remainder 0.\n\nYes, that looks correct. So, the GCD is indeed 56.\n\nTherefore, the greatest possible length of the pieces that can be cut from both wires without any remainder is 56 cm.\n\nI think that's it. I can't see any mistakes in my calculations, so I'm confident that 56 cm is the correct answer.","full_output":"Alright, so I have this problem here about two wires with lengths 448 cm and 616 cm, and I need to figure out the greatest possible length of pieces that can be cut from them without any remainder.

But she sold 45 boxes, so she needs 45 minus 36, which is 9 more boxes. \n\nSo, she needs 3 cases of 12 boxes each, which gives her 36 boxes, and then 9 extra boxes to make up the total of 45. That makes sense because 36 plus 9 is 45. So, she needs 3 cases plus 9 extra boxes. \n\nWait, but the question says \"cases of 12 boxes, plus extra boxes.\" So, the answer should be the number of cases plus the extra boxes. That would be 3 cases plus 9 boxes, which is 3 and 9. But usually, when they ask for cases and extra boxes, they just want the total number of boxes in cases plus the extra. So, maybe the answer is 3 cases and 9 boxes, but the question is phrased as \"how many cases of 12 boxes, plus extra boxes does Nancy need?\" So, perhaps the answer is 3 cases and 9 extra boxes, but the user wants it in a specific format.\n\nBut looking at the examples, when they had to round up, they just put the total number as a whole number. For example, in example 3, the final answer was 5. So, maybe I need to present the total number of boxes needed, which is 3 cases (36 boxes) plus 9 extra, so 45 boxes total. So, the answer is 45 boxes, which is 3 cases and 9 extra.\n\nWait, but the hint says to round up if there's a remainder. So, 45 divided by 12 is 3 with a remainder of 9, so you need to round up to the next whole case. But wait, 3 cases give you 36, which is less than 45. So, actually, you need to have enough for 45 boxes. So, 45 divided by 12 is 3.75. Since you can't have a fraction of a case, you round up to 4 cases. But wait, that would give you 48 boxes, which is more than 45. But the question is asking for cases plus extra boxes, not just cases.\n\nHmm, so maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think again. If she has 45 boxes, and each case is 12, how many cases does she need? 45 ÷ 12 is 3.75, so she needs 4 cases to cover all 45 boxes. But since she can't buy a fraction of a case, she needs 4 cases, which is 48 boxes. But then, she would have 3 extra boxes (48 - 45 = 3). But the question is asking for cases plus extra boxes, so it's 4 cases plus 3 extra boxes, but that's 48 boxes total. Alternatively, if she buys 3 cases (36 boxes), she needs 9 more boxes to reach 45.\n\nSo, the question is, does she need to buy cases and then extra boxes, or just the total number of boxes? The wording says \"cases of 12 boxes, plus extra boxes.\" So, she needs a certain number of cases, and then if there are extra boxes beyond that, she needs those too. So, the number of cases is the whole number division, and the extra boxes are the remainder.\n\nSo, 45 ÷ 12 is 3 with a remainder of 9. So, she needs 3 cases (36 boxes) and 9 extra boxes. Therefore, the answer is 3 cases and 9 extra boxes, but the question is asking for how many cases plus extra boxes, so maybe it's 3 cases plus 9 boxes, which is 45 boxes total.
