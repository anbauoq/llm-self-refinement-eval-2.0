Let me start by understanding the question and the reasoning.\n\nThe question is about a relay race where there are 5 people on the Green Bay High track team. The race is 150 meters long, and all 5 team members participate. The reasoning given is that a standard relay race uses 4 runners, so with 5 members, one will sit out. Then, each runner covers 5/4 of the race distance, leading to 150 * (5/4) = 187.5 meters. But the correct answer is actually <MSK>, which is way off.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. The reasoning seems to be incorrect because it's assuming that each runner covers a fraction of the total distance, but in reality, each runner covers a portion of the race that's divided among them. Maybe the misunderstanding is about how the relay works.\n\nIn a standard 4-person relay, each runner covers one leg of the race, typically equal in length. So if the race is 150 meters, each runner runs 150 meters. But with 5 members, perhaps they're trying to split the race into 5 parts, but that doesn't fit the relay"}
