That makes sense because the total number of participants should be the sum of those who gave a positive response and those who gave a negative response.\n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal students = Students who liked the menu + Students who didn't like the menu\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers from the problem:\n\nTotal students = 235 + 165\n\nNow, let me do the addition.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many students participated in Sofia's survey. She asked about the new menu and found that 235 students liked it, while 165 didn't. To find the total number of students who took part, I should add these two numbers together because everyone who participated either liked or didn't like the menu. \n\nSo, 235 plus 165 equals... let me add that. 200 plus 100 is 300, and 35 plus 65 is 100. So, 300 plus 100 is 400. Therefore, the total number of students who took part in the survey is 400.\n</think>\n\nThe total number of students who participated in Sofia's survey is found by adding the number of students who liked the new menu to those who didn't. \n\n235 students liked the menu, and 165 didn't.

The problem only mentions that she bought cookies and juice, but doesn't specify the amounts spent on each. It just gives the total amount she had before and after the purchases. So, perhaps the only information we can extract is the total amount spent, which is $19, but without knowing how much went to cookies, we can't determine the exact amount spent on juice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem implies that she only bought juice after buying cookies, and the $50 left is specifically from the money after buying cookies.

So, the question is about a basketball game where the main team scored 68 points and led by 29 points. We need to find out the Green Team's final score.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"led by 29 points\" means. In sports, especially basketball, the lead can be calculated by subtracting the opponent's score from the leading team's score. So, if our team scored 68 points and led by 29, that means the difference between their score and the opponent's is 29.\n\nLet me put that into an equation. Let G be the Green Team's score.

So, if I let G represent the Green Team's score, then the main team's score minus the Green Team's score equals 29. In math terms, that would be:\n\n68 - G = 29\n\nNow, I need to solve for G. To do that, I'll subtract 29 from both sides of the equation to isolate G.\n\n68 - 29 = G\n39 = G\n\nSo, the Green Team scored 39 points.\n\nJust to make sure I didn't make a mistake, I'll plug the numbers back into the original statement. If the main team scored 68 and the Green Team scored 39, the difference is indeed 68 - 39 = 29. That checks out, so I think I did it right.\n\nI guess that's it then.

So, 9 minus 5 equals 4.\n\nFinally, the hundreds place: 3 minus 2 equals 1.\n\nPutting it all together, the subtraction gives us 47 lbs.\n\nSo, the mayor still needs to provide 47 lbs of cocoa powder.\n</think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how much cocoa powder the mayor still needs to give.

So, there are 44 adults on the bus.\n\nNow, to find the number of children, I'll subtract the number of adults from the total passengers.\n\nChildren\n\nAlright, let's break down the problem step by step. We have a total of 54 passengers on the bus. Out of these, 18 are men and 26 are women. The rest are children. To find out how many children there are, I need to subtract the number of men and women from the total number of passengers.\n\nFirst, I'll add the number of men and women together to find the total number of adults:\n18 (men) + 26 (women) = 44 adults.\n\nNext, I'll subtract the number of adults from the total number of passengers to find the number of children:\n54 (total passengers) - 44 (adults) = 10 children.\n\nSo, there are 10 children on the bus.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{10}","ground_truth":"10","predicted_answer":"10","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

When they reach the first stop, 5 people get on and 2 get off. So, the number of people on the bus changes by 5 + 2, which is a net increase of 3 people. \n\nThen, two stops later, meaning after the first stop, they go to the second stop and then to the terminal. At the terminal, 7 people get on and 15 get off. That means 7 + 15 = 22 people get off or on, but since they're getting off, it's a decrease. So, the net change at the terminal is -8 people because 15 more people got off than got on.\n\nWait, no, actually, when people get on,","ground_truth":"5","predicted_answer":"7","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

The problem says that Tara has $4 more than Megan, and together they have enough money to buy the scooter. We need to figure out how much money Tara had.\n\nLet me start by defining some variables. Let’s say Megan has M dollars. Since Tara has $4 more than Megan, Tara must have M + 4 dollars.\n\nNow, together, Megan and Tara have M + (M + 4) dollars, which simplifies to 2M + 4 dollars.

Mrs. Randall has been teaching third grade for 18 years and second grade for 8 years. We need to find the total number of years she's been teaching.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information:\n- She taught third grade for 18 years.\n- She also taught second grade for 8 years.\n\nSince these are two different grades, and she can't teach both at the same time, these years are separate. Therefore, the total number of years she's been teaching is the sum of these two periods.\n\nAdding them together:\n18 years (third grade) + 8 years (second grade) = 26 years.\n\nSo, Mrs. Randall has been teaching for a total of 26 years.","full_output":"Okay, so Mrs. Randall has been teaching third grade for 18 years, and this year she has 26 students. She also taught second grade for 8 years. I need to find out the total number of years she has been teaching.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information. She taught third grade for 18 years. That's straightforward. Then, she taught second grade for 8 years. So, to find the total, I should add those two periods together.\n\nWait, but does teaching second grade for 8 years include all the years she was also teaching third grade? Or are the second grade years separate? I think they are separate because she taught third grade for 18 years, and then she also taught second grade for 8 years. So, it's like she has two different teaching periods: third grade for 18 years and second grade for 8 years. Therefore, the total years she's been teaching would be the sum of these two periods.\n\nSo, adding 18 years of third grade and 8 years of second grade gives us 18 + 8 = 26 years. That seems straightforward. I don't think there's any overlap or double-counting here because she taught each grade in separate years.\n\nWait, but\n\nAlright, so Mrs. Randall has been teaching third grade for 18 years and second grade for 8 years. To find out the total number of years she's been teaching, I need to add those two periods together.\n\nFirst, let's consider her third grade teaching period. She taught third grade for 18 years. That's clear.\n\nNext, she also taught second grade for 8 years. Since she taught second grade in addition to third grade, these are separate periods. There's no overlap because she can't teach two grades simultaneously in the same year, unless she's teaching different classes at the same time, but that's not specified here. So, it's safe to assume that the 8 years of second grade teaching are in addition to the 18 years of third grade.\n\nTherefore, to find the total number of years she's been teaching, I should add the two numbers: 18 years (third grade) + 8 years (second grade) = 26 years.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there's any possibility of overlap. For example, if she taught both second and third grade in the same year, that might affect the total count.

Dividing 3500\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. Cory has a total of 4500 grams of candy. He saves 1 kilogram for later, which is 1000 grams. So, the amount he has left is 4500 minus 1000, which equals 3500 grams. He wants to divide this remaining candy equally among 7 bowls. To find out how much each bowl gets, we divide 3500 grams by 7. \n\nSo, 3500 divided by 7 is 500. That means each bowl will have 500 grams of candy. I've double-checked my calculations, and everything adds up correctly. Therefore, Cory serves 500 grams of candy in each bowl.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{500}","ground_truth":"500","predicted_answer":"500","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

We need to find the difference between the number of squirrels and nuts. \n\nFirst, I'll note down the numbers: squirrels = 4 and nuts = 2. To find the difference, I can subtract the number of nuts from the number of squirrels. So, 4 minus 2 equals 2. \n\nAlternatively, if I were to subtract the number of squirrels from the nuts, that would be 2 minus 4, which is negative 2. However, since difference is typically considered as a positive value, it makes sense to take the absolute value. Therefore, the difference is 2.\n\nI should make sure that I'm following the instructions correctly.

There were four sticks left after he picked up. To find the difference, subtract the number he picked up from the total sticks. However, since there were still sticks left, we need to consider the total number of sticks. If he picked up fourteen and four were left, the total number of sticks is 14 + 4 = 18. The difference between the number he picked up and the left is 14 - 4 = 10. But since we're asked for the difference between the number he picked up and the left, it's 14 - 4 = 10. However, considering the total sticks, the difference is 18 - 4 = 14. The correct interpretation is that he picked up fourteen, and four remained, so the difference between what he picked up and the remaining is 14 - 4 = 10.

So, Dave is picking up sticks from his yard. He picked up fourteen sticks, but there were still four left. The question is asking for the difference between the number of sticks he picked up and the left ones.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what exactly is being asked. The difference between two numbers is usually found by subtracting the smaller number from the larger one. In this case, the numbers are 14 (sticks he picked up) and 4 (sticks left). \n\nSo, the difference would be 14 minus 4. That calculation gives us 10. So, the difference between the number of sticks he picked up and the left ones is 10 sticks.\n\nWait, but I want to make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. It says, \"the difference between the number of sticks that Dave picked up and the left.\" That means we're looking at how many more sticks he picked up compared to what was left. Since he picked up more than what remained, the difference should be a positive number.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider the total number of sticks. If he picked up 14 and 4 were left, the total would be 14 + 4 =\n\nAlright, so I need to figure out the difference between the number of sticks Dave picked up and the ones that were left.

I need to find the difference between how many they had before selling and after selling.\n\nHmm, the difference usually means subtraction. So, it's the number they had before selling minus the number left after selling. That makes sense because they sold some, so the difference would be how many they sold.\n\nLet me write that down. The initial number is 91, and the remaining is 20. So, the difference is 91 minus 20.\n\nCalculating that, 91 minus 20 equals 71. So, they sold 71 hotdogs.\n\nWait, let me double-check.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the area of a square is calculated by squaring the length of one of its sides. Since it's a square, all sides are equal. So if the area is 100 square feet, that means the side length must be the square root of 100. Let me write that down.\n\nArea = side² = 100\nSo, side = √100 = 10 feet.

That means each binder has 109 cards. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. 7 binders times 109 cards each should give me back the total. So, 7 times 100 is 700, and 7 times 9 is 63. Adding those together, 700 + 63 is 763, which matches the total number of cards. So, that makes sense. \n\nI don't think there are any other steps needed here. It's a straightforward division problem since each binder has the same number of cards. So, the answer should be 109 cards per\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. Edward has a total of 763 baseball cards spread across 7 binders. The key here is that each binder has the same number of cards. To find out how many cards are in each binder, we need to divide the total number of cards by the number of binders.\n\nSo, the first thing I'll do is set up the division: 763 divided by 7. \n\nLet me do the division:\n\n7 goes into 7 once, so that's 100. Then, 7 goes into 63 nine times, which adds up to 109. \n\nTo double-check, I'll multiply 109 by 7 to ensure it equals 763. \n\n109 times 7: 100 times 7 is 700, and 9 times 7 is 63. Adding those together gives 700 + 63 = 763, which matches the total number of cards Edward has.\n\nTherefore, each binder contains 109 cards.\n</think>\n\nThe number of cards in each binder is found by dividing the total number of cards by the number of binders: 763 ÷ 7 = 109.\n\n\\boxed{109}","ground_truth":"109","predicted_answer":"109","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

The ratio of books to bookmarks is 9:2, so for every 9 books sold, they sold 2 bookmarks. That means the number of bookmarks sold is related to the number of books sold by this proportion.\n\nSo, if 9 books correspond to 2 bookmarks, then 1 book would correspond to 2/9 bookmarks.

So, the parking lot has 35 empty spaces, and the ratio of empty spaces to taken spaces is 5:4. I need to find the total number of spaces.\n\nFirst, I'll denote the number of empty spaces as 5x and the number of taken spaces as 4x, where x is a common multiplier. This way, the ratio of empty to taken spaces is maintained as 5:4.\n\nGiven that the number of empty spaces is 35, I can set up the equation:\n5x = 35\n\nTo find x, I'll divide both sides by 5:\nx = 35 / 5\nx = 7\n\nNow that I have x, I can find the number of taken spaces:\nTaken spaces = 4x = 4 * 7 = 28\n\nFinally, to find the total number of spaces, I'll add the empty and taken spaces together:\nTotal spaces = Empty spaces + Taken spaces = 35 + 28 = 63\n\nSo, the total number of spaces in the parking lot is 63.\n</think>\n\nThe total number of spaces in the parking lot is \\boxed{63}.","ground_truth":"63","predicted_answer":"63","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

So, 97 minus 58 equals 39.\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I add 58 and 39 together, does it equal 97? 58 plus 30 is 88, and then plus 9 is 97. Yep, that adds up correctly. So, the subtraction is correct.\n\nTherefore, after eating fifty-eight cupcakes, Adam has 39 left. That seems straightforward. I don't think I missed anything\n\nAlright, let me figure out how many cupcakes Adam has left after eating fifty-eight. He started with ninety-seven. So, I need to subtract fifty-eight from ninety-seven. Let me write that down: 97 - 58. \n\nHmm, subtracting 58 from 97. Maybe I can break it down. 97 minus 50 is 47, and then subtract 8 more, which gives me 39. So, 97 minus 58 is 39. Let me double-check to make sure. If I add 58 and 39, I should get back to 97. 58 plus 30 is 88, and then plus 9 is 97. Yep, that works out.

Let's denote the number of liters sold for each color as \\( x \\).\n\nYellow paint is sold in 2-liter containers. So, if they sold \\( x \\) liters of yellow paint, the number of containers sold would be \\( \\frac{x}{2} \\). But since we're focusing on the liters sold, not the containers, we can keep it as \\( x \\) liters.\n\nBlue paint is sold in 19-liter containers. So, to have an equal quantity sold, they must have sold \\( x \\) liters of blue paint as well. The number of containers for blue paint would be \\( \\frac{x}{19} \\), but again, we're just concerned with the liters sold.\n\nThe key here is to find the smallest \\( x \\) that","predicted_answer":null,"ground_truth":"38","is_correct":null,"was_retried":true}

{"id":1832,"question":"At the arcade Amy had 6 tickets she saved from the last time she went. This time she played a game 7 times and earned 5 tickets each time she played.

Now, this time, she played a game 7 times, and each time she played, she earned 5 tickets. I need to figure out how many tickets she has now.\n\nFirst, let me break it down. She started with 6 tickets. Then she earned more tickets from playing the game. Each game she played gave her 5 tickets, and she played 7 games. So, to find out how many tickets she got from playing, I can multiply the number of games by the tickets per game. That would be 7 times 5, which is 35. \n\nNow, she had 6 tickets before, and she earned 35 from playing. To find the total number of tickets she has now, I should add those together. So, 6 plus 35 equals 41. \n\nLet me double-check that. She had 6 to start with. Each game gives 5, and she played 7 games, so 7 times 5 is indeed 35. Adding 6 and 35 gives 41. Yep, that makes sense.

Hmm, so I need to calculate how many tickets she got from playing the game. \n\nIf she played 7 times and got 5 tickets each time, I can multiply 7 by 5 to find out the total number of tickets she earned from playing. \n\n7 times 5 equals 35. So, she earned 35 tickets from playing the game. \n\nNow, I need to add the tickets she had from before to the tickets she earned this time. She had 6 tickets saved, and she earned 35 tickets from playing. \n\nAdding those together: 6 plus 35 equals 41. \n\nTherefore, Amy has a total of 41 tickets now.\n</think>\n\nAmy had 6 tickets saved from her last visit.

Out of these, Faye herself scored 28 points. This means the remaining points were scored by the other players on her team.\n\nTo find out how many points were scored by the other players, we subtract Faye's points from the total points:\n\n68 total points - 28 points (Faye) = 40 points scored by others.\n\nNow, each of the other players scored 8 points each. To find out how many players scored these points, we divide the total points scored by the other players by the number of points each player scored:\n\n40 points / 8 points per player = 5 players.\n\nTherefore, there were 5 players on Faye's team.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{5}","ground_truth":"5","predicted_answer":"5","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

Subtracting that from 1804 gives me 1804 - 1640 = 164. \n\nNow, I need to see how many more times 82 goes into 164. 82*2=164. So that means 20 + 2 = 22. So, 82*22=1804. That means each friend gets 22 cookies.\n\nAs for the candy, Chris has 10 pieces","full_output":"Alright, so Chris is inviting 82 friends to a party and he has some cookies and candy to distribute.
