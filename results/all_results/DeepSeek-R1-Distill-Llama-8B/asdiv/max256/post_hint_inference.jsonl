First, I should find the total amount they have together. That would be Ann's money plus Bill's money. So, $777 plus $1,111. Let me add those numbers: 777 + 1111. 700 + 1100 is 1800, and 77 + 11 is 88, so together that makes 1888.

Hmm, 700 + 1,100 is 1,800, and 77 + 11 is 88. So together, they have $1,888.\n\nNow, since they want to have the same amount, each of them should have half of the total. So, I'll divide 1,888 by 2. That gives me 944. So each should have $944.\n\nAnn currently has $777, which is less than $944. That means Bill needs to give her the difference.

The team won most of their games, so they must have won more than they lost.\n\nFirst, I need to determine how many games were played during the day. Since 2 games were at night, the remaining games must have been during the day. So, 18 total games minus 2 night games equals 16 day games.\n\nNow, they were defeated in 3 games. These 3 losses could be a combination of day and night games. However, the problem doesn't specify how many losses occurred at night. But since only 2 games were played at night, the maximum number of losses they could have at night is 2. Therefore, the remaining losses must have occurred during the day.\n\nSo, if they lost 3 games in total and at most 2 could be at night, then they lost 1 game during the day. That means the number of losses during the day is 1. \n\nNow, the total games played during the day were 16. If they lost 1 day game, the remaining games must be wins.

The problem doesn't specify whether these losses happened during the day or at night, but it does mention that two games were at night. So, the maximum number of losses that could have occurred at night is two because there were only two night games.

Therefore, they lost one game during the day and two games at night.\n\nNow, focusing on the day games: there were 16 day games in total, and they lost one of those. So, the number of games they won during the day would be the total day games minus the losses during the day.
