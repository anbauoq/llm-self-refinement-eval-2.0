With a 20% increase in income, the new expenditure is 70% of 120% of the original income, which equals 84% of the original income.

Comparing","ground_truth":"A","predicted_answer":"D","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false,"hint_sentence":"Alright, let me try to figure out the hint for this question. The question is about a man who spends 70% of his income. When his income increases by 20%, we need to find his new expenditure. \n\nFirst, I should understand the problem step by step. The man's original income is I. He spends 70% of I, so his expenditure is 0.7I. If his income goes up by 20%, his new income is 1.2I because 20% of I is 0.2I, so I + 0.2I = 1.2I.\n\nNow, the new expenditure would be 70% of this increased income. So, 70% of 1.2I is calculated as 0.7 * 1.2I. Let me do that multiplication: 0.7 times 1.2. Hmm, 0.7 times 1 is 0.7, and 0.7 times 0.2 is 0.14, so adding those together gives 0.84. Therefore, the new expenditure is 0.84I, which is 84% of his original income.\n\nThe original expenditure was 70%, so"}
