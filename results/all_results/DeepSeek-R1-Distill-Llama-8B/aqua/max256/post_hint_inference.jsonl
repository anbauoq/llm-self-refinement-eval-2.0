Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nHe spends Rs. 3500 every month. That means whatever money he has left after spending is what he saves. Additionally, he saves 12.5% of his income. So, his savings come from two parts: the leftover after spending and the 12.5% he intentionally saves from his income.\n\nLet me denote his monthly income as I. So, the amount he saves from his income is 12.5% of I, which is 0.125 * I.\n\nNow, the amount left after his monthly expenses is I - 3500. This leftover amount should be equal to his savings from 12.5% of his income because he's not spending that money, just saving it.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation: I - 3500 = 0.125 * I.\n\nTo solve for I, I'll subtract 0.125 * I from both sides to get the terms involving I on one side.\n\nI - 0.125I = 3500\n\nSimplifying the left side, 1 - 0.125 is 0.875, so\n\nThe man's monthly income is Rs. 4000.
