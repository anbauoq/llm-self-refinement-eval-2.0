It\n\n<think>\nOkay, let me analyze this. The user is asking for a single final answer to the question about the plausibility of Jerami Grant doing a double stepover. They've emphasized that I should only provide the boxed answer, nothing else. But in my initial response, I included a step-by-step reasoning block, which seems to be against their instructions here.\n\nWait, looking back at the examples provided earlier, the format requires two blocks: first the reasoning, then the boxed answer. However, the user now says, \"Now return ONLY single final answer to the question inside \\boxed{}.\" This might be conflicting with the previous instructions. Let me check the context.\n\nThe user initially set up the task with examples that include both the reasoning and the boxed answer. Then, in this query, they specify that they want \"ONLY single final answer\" in the boxed format. But the examples show that the reasoning is part of the output. Maybe the user is clarifying that after the reasoning, only the boxed answer should be provided, but in the examples, the reasoning is included before the box.\n\nHmm, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. In the original setup, the assistant was supposed to output two blocks: reasoning and then the boxed answer. But the user now\n\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. The question is whether the sentence \"Jerami Grant did a double stepover\" is plausible in a real-world sports setting. From the hint, Jerami Grant is a professional basketball player, so we're dealing with basketball here.\n\nNow, \"double stepover\" is a specific basketball term. I remember that a stepover is a type of crossover move where the player steps over the defender's foot to change direction. A double stepover might be an advanced version of this, requiring more footwork and agility. \n\nBasketball players, especially skilled ones like Jerami Grant, who I believe plays for the Detroit Pistons, are known to perform various crossover moves to avoid defenders. Crossovers are common in basketball, and advanced moves like double stepovers are part of a player's repertoire to create space or drive to the basket. \n\nSo, considering that Jerami Grant is a professional basketball player, it's entirely plausible for him to perform a double stepover during a game. This move is a standard part of basketball skills, and there's no reason to doubt that a player of his level could execute it. Therefore, the sentence is reasonable and plausible.\n</think>\n\\boxed{1}","ground_truth":"0","predicted_answer":"1","is_correct":false,"was_retried":true}

The sentence is: \"Marquise Brown did a maradona on the defender.\" First, I need to know who Marquise Brown is. He's an NFL player, specifically a wide receiver. Then, what is a \"Maradona\"? The hint says it's a specific football (soccer) maneuver. So in soccer, a Maradona is a type of dribble where the player controls the ball and moves past defenders with skill, like Maradona himself did.\n\nBut in American football, the term \"Maradona\" isn't used. Instead, we have terms like \"cut,\" \"breakaway,\" \"post,\" etc., for receiver movements. The action described here is \"did a Maradona on the defender,\" which implies a specific skill move. However, in football, receivers don't \"do Maradonas\" because that term doesn't exist in the sport. Even though Brown is a football player, the maneuver mentioned is from soccer, making the sentence contextually incorrect. Therefore, this sentence is not plausible in a real-world sports setting.\n\nSo the final answer should be 0.\n</think>\n\\boxed{0}","ground_truth":"0","predicted_answer":"0","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

In baseball, \"safe\" means a runner reaches a base without being out, and \"first\" refers to first base. This is commonly used in describing plays at the plate, like when a batter hits a single and reaches first base safely.\n\nNow, considering the context, since Max Scherzer is a pitcher, he's on the defensive side. But the phrase \"safe at first\" is typically used when talking about batters or base runners. However, in baseball, the term \"safe\" can apply to any runner, including the batter. So, for example, if a batter hits the ball and reaches first base without being out, we say they were safe at first.\n\nThere's no indication that this phrase is being used in a different sport.
