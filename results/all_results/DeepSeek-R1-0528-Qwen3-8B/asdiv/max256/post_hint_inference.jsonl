The incorrect answer they provided was 72, which is likely the result of multiplying 9 by 8 or something similar.\n\nFor my hint, I need to guide the model toward the correct approach without directly stating what they should do or what the correct answer is. The key here is that the model needs to realize they should first find the total number of flowers by adding the carnations and roses together, and then divide that total by the number of flowers each vase can hold.\n\nI should focus on the quantities involved - the four carnations, twenty-three roses, and the nine flowers per vase.

There are four carnations and twenty-three roses. So, adding those together: 4 + 23 = 27 flowers in total.\n\nEach vase can hold nine flowers. To find out how many vases are needed, I divide the total number of flowers by the capacity of each vase. So, 27 ÷ 9 = 3.\n\nI should consider if there's any partial vases needed. Since 27 divided by 9 is exactly 3, there are no leftover flowers. So, three vases should be sufficient.\n\nNow, checking the examples provided: In example 1, the answer was 72, which is the sum of clips sold in April and May. In example 2, it was 10, calculated from the earnings. Example 3 was 5, the remaining money needed. Example 4 was 42, half of the remaining pages.
