The wording says \"there are a total of 40 cows for every cow herd.\" That seems straightforward. It means each herd has 40 cows.\n\nAnd \"there are 8 cow herds in the farm.\" So, total cows should be number of herds multiplied by cows per herd.\n\nNo other complications mentioned, like different sizes or anything. So, 8 herds * 40 cows/herd = 320 cows.\n\nNow, I need to\n\n<think>\nThe question is: Ben on the other hand, was asked to count the number of cows that they have.

With 8 herds, the total number of cows is 8 multiplied by 40.\n\nCalculating that: 8 * 40 = 320.\n\nThe final answer should be the total number of cows, which is 320.\n\nNow, I need to output only the final answer in the boxed format, as per the user's request.

The discount is applied once for the entire group of siblings.\n\nBut in the context, it's probably the first one, because it says \"per person\" and then \"discount for siblings,\" which might mean that the sibling discount is an additional benefit per person.\n\nHowever, looking back at the examples, in example\n\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. The question is: Tuition is $45 per person, and there's a $15 discount for siblings.

Let me double-check. The tuition is $45 per person, and the discount is $15 for each sibling. So yes, each gets $15 off, so $45 - $15 = $30 each, total $60.\n\nBut sometimes discounts might be applied differently, like a family discount.

I need to pour this into five glasses, each with the same amount. So, I have to divide 153 pints by 5.\n\nLet me do the division: 153 ÷ 5.\n\n5 times 30 is 150, and 153 minus 150 is 3. So, 30 with a remainder of 3.

The division here is straightforward: 153 divided by 5. \n\nCalculating it out: 5 × 30 = 150, and 153 - 150 = 3, so 30 with a remainder of 3.

The question asks for the number of blocks each friend gets when sharing the blocks among 4 friends.\n\nLaura has 28 blocks. She's sharing them with 4 friends. So, I need to divide the total number of blocks by the number of friends.\n\nThat means 28 divided by 4.\n\nLet me calculate that: 28 ÷ 4 = 7.\n\nSo, each friend gets 7 blocks.\n\nNow, the cards are given: 8 cards. But the question is only about blocks, so I shouldn't consider the cards at all. They might be a red herring or just additional information not needed for the answer.\n\nThe output must be exactly two blocks: one for reasoning and one for the answer. No extra text.\n\nReasoning should be step-by-step, and the answer should be just the number in a boxed format.\n\nFrom the examples, the reasoning is concise and directly answers the question without mentioning irrelevant details.\n\nIn example 6","full_output":"<think>\nFirst, the question is: Laura has 28 blocks and 8 cards. If she shares the blocks among 4 friends, how many blocks does each friend get?\n\nI need to focus only on the blocks, since the cards are mentioned but not relevant to the question.
