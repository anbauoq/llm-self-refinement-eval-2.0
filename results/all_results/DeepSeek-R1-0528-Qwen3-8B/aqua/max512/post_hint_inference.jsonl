The correct option is C.\n\\boxed{C}\n```","full_output":"<think>\nHmm, this is an interesting problem about factors of a number. Let me think about this carefully. The question states that Q is a positive integer with exactly 5 factors, and we need to determine which statements must be true.\n\nFirst, I recall that the number of factors of a number can be found from its prime factorization. If a number N has prime factorization N = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak, then the total number of factors is (a1+1)*(a2+1)*...*(ak+1).\n\nIn this case, Q has exactly 5 factors. Since 5 is a prime number, this means the only way to express 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 = 5*1. So the prime factorization must be of the form p^4, where p is prime. This gives factors: 1, p, p^2, p^3, p^4 - exactly 5 factors.\n\nNow, let's examine the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number. This would be p^2, which has factors 1, p, p^2 - only 3 factors, not 5. So this is false.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime number. This is p^4, which we've established has exactly 5 factors. So this is true.\n\nIII. Q is the product of two prime numbers. If they are distinct, this would be p*q, with factors 1, p, q, p*q - 4 factors. If they are the same, it's p^2 with 3 factors. Neither gives 5 factors. So this is false.\n\nTherefore, only statement II must be true. The correct answer is C) II only.\n\nBut the user provided examples where the correct answer was sometimes III only, but in this case it's clearly II only. Perhaps there's a misunderstanding in the question or options.\n\nWait, looking at the options again: A) I only, B) III only, C) II only, D) I and II only, E) I and III only.\n\nYes, C is II only.\n\nBut the user said \"Correct answer: <MSK>\" which is III only. That seems incorrect based on my reasoning.\n\nPerhaps the user meant to say that the answer is not B, but something else. Or maybe they are testing if I can identify that III\n\nThe question asks about a positive integer Q with exactly 5 factors. The number of factors is determined by the prime factorization.
