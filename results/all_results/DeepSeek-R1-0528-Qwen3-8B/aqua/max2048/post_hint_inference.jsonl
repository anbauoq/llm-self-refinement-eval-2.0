{"id":64,"question":"Amy is organizing her bookshelves and finds that she has 10 different types of books. She then codes each book with either a single letter or a pair of two different letters.

(Assume the order of letters in a pair does not matter.)\n\nOptions:\nA)3\nB)4\nC)5\nD)10\nE)20","chain_of_thought":"First, I need to find the smallest number of letters that Amy can use to create 10 unique codes. Each code is either a single letter or a pair of two different letters, and the order in the pair doesn't matter. So, for example, if she has letters A, B, C, the codes could be A, B, C, AB, AC, BC, etc.\n\nThis is a problem about combinations. I need to maximize the number of unique codes with a minimal number of letters. The codes include singles and pairs.\n\nLet n be the number of letters. The number of single-letter codes is n, because each letter can be a unique code by itself.\n\nThe number of pair-letter codes is the number of ways to choose 2 different letters out of n, which is given by the combination formula C(n, 2) = n! / (2! * (n-2)!) = n*(n-1)/2.\n\nSo, the total number of unique codes with n letters is the sum of single-letter codes and pair-letter codes: n + C(n, 2) = n + n*(n-1)/2.\n\nI need this total to be at least 10, since there are 10 different types of books to code uniquely.\n\nSo, I need n + n*(n-1)/2 >= 10.\n\nI should find the smallest integer n such that this inequality holds.\n\nLet me write the inequality: n + n(n-1)/2 >= 10.\n\nTo make it easier, let's combine terms. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the denominator: 2n + n(n-1) >= 20.\n\nSimplify: 2n + n^2 - n >= 20 → n^2 + n >= 20.\n\nNow, solve the quadratic equation n^2 + n - 20 = 0.\n\nUsing the quadratic formula: n = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 80)] / 2 = [-1 ± sqrt(81)] / 2 = [-1 ± 9]/2.\n\nPositive root: n = ( -1 + 9 ) / 2 = 8 / 2 = 4.\n\nNegative root: n = ( -1 - 9 ) / 2 = -10 / 2 = -5, which doesn't make sense for number of letters.\n\nSo, n^2 + n - 20 = 0 has root n=4.\n\nBut since it's an inequality n^2 + n >= 20, and at n=4, 4^2 + 4 = 16 + 4 = 20, which equals 20, so it should be exactly 20 when n=4.\n\nNow, total codes with n=4: singles = 4, pairs = C(4,2) = 6, so total = 4 + 6 = 10.\n\nExactly 10 codes.\n\nAnd the question asks for the smallest number of letters to create at least 10 unique codes.\n\nWith n=4, total codes are 10, which is exactly what's needed.\n\nBut is this the smallest? Let me check n=3.\n\nWith n=3 letters, say A,B,C.\n\nSingles: A, B, C → 3 codes.\n\nPairs: AB, AC, BC → C(3,2) = 3 codes.\n\nTotal codes: 3 + 3 = 6, which is less than 10.\n\nSo, with 3 letters, only 6 unique codes, but we need 10.\n\nTherefore, n=4 is the smallest number that gives at least 10 codes.\n\nNow, looking at the options: A)3, B)4, C)5, D)10, E)20.\n\nSo, B)4 should be the answer.\n\nBut let me double-check. The hint says \"the total number of unique codes required is 10\", and with n=4, we have 10 codes: the four singles and six pairs.\n\nAnd since the codes must be unique, and we have exactly 10 with n=4, it should work.\n\nIs there any restriction I missed? The problem says \"each type of book is uniquely represented by either a single letter or pair of letters\", and we're using both, so no issue.\n\nAlso, the order in the pair doesn't matter, which is already accounted for in combinations.\n\nSo, smallest n is 4.\n\nBut let me see if with n=4, all codes are distinct. Yes, because single letters are different from pairs, and pairs are all distinct combinations.\n\nFor example, codes: A, B, C, D, AB, AC, AD, BC, BD, CD. That's 4 singles and 6 pairs, total 10, all unique.\n\nAnd for n=3, only 6, which is insufficient.\n\nSo, answer should be B)4.\n\nThe options include D)10 and E)20, which are larger, but we're looking for the smallest.\n\nA)3 is too small, as we saw.\n\nC)5 would give more than 10, but it's larger than necessary.\n\nSo, yes.\n\nI could think about it differently. The maximum number of codes with n letters is n + C(n,2).\n\nWe need this to be at least 10.\n\nn + n(n-1)/2 >= 10.\n\nFor n=4: 4 + 4*3/2 = 4 + 12/2 = 4 + 6 = 10.\n\nFor n=5: 5 + 5*4/2 = 5 + 20/2 = 5 + 10 = 15, which is more than 10, but larger.\n\nSo, smallest n is 4.\n\nThe question is to find the smallest number of letters, and with 4, it works.\n\nIs there a way to have codes with fewer than 4 letters but still get 10 unique codes? No, because with 3, maximum is 6.\n\nUnless she uses only pairs or something, but the coding system allows both, and we need to use both to maximize the number of codes.\n\nBut in this case, with n=4, it's exactly 10, so no need for more.\n\nPerhaps the single letters and pairs can overlap in some way, but no, the codes are distinct entities, so a single letter code is different from a pair code.\n\nFor example, the code \"A\" is different from \"AB\", even though \"A\" is part of \"AB\".\n\nSo, yes, they are distinct.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number is 4.\n\nSo, the answer is B.","full_output":"<think>\nFirst, I need to find the smallest number of letters that Amy can use to create 10 unique codes.

The speed along the current is the still water speed plus the current speed.\n\nLet the still water speed be S = 4 kmph.\n\nLet the current speed be C kmph.\n\nAgainst the current: S - C = 2 kmph.\n\nSo, 4 - C = 2.\n\nI can solve for C.\n\n4 - C = 2 implies C = 4 - 2 = 2 kmph.\n\nNow, along the current: S + C = 4 + 2 = 6 kmph.\n\nSo, the rate along the current is 6 kmph.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA)15 kmph\n\nB)6 kmph\n\nC)12 kmph\n\nD)14 kmph\n\nE)6 kmph\n\nOptions B and E are both 6 kmph. That might be a typo in the question or options. But according to my calculation, it's 6 kmph.\n\nI should double-check.\n\nStill water speed: 4 kmph.\n\nAgainst current: 2 kmph.\n\nSo, against current speed is still water minus current: 4 - C = 2, so C = 2 kmph.\n\nThen along current: 4 + 2 = 6 kmph.\n\nYes, that seems correct.\n\nNow, the options have B and E both as 6 kmph. Probably a mistake, but since the answer is 6, it should be B or E. But in multiple-choice, usually options are unique, but here it's listed twice.\n\nPerhaps I need to select one. But the hint and calculation point to 6 kmph.\n\nMaybe the question is implying something else, but based on standard boat and stream problems, this should be it.\n\nAnother way to think: the man's rowing speed is given as 4 kmph in still water, and against current it's 2 kmph, so the current is opposing him, so yes, S - C = 2.\n\nC = 2 kmph.\n\nAlong current: S + C = 6 kmph.\n\nNow, options B and E are the same. But in the list, B is 6 kmph and E is also 6 kmph. Perhaps it's a copy-paste error.\n\nBut regardless, the answer is 6 kmph.\n\nI should look at the other options to see if there's any trick.\n\nOption A is 15, which is way higher.\n\nC is 12, which is 4 + 8 or something, but current is 2.\n\nD is 14, not matching.\n\nSo, definitely 6 kmph.\n\nBut since B and E are both correct, I need to choose one. The instruction is to output exactly one uppercase letter, so probably I should pick B, as it's listed first.\n\nPerhaps the question has a typo, but based on the given, I'll go with 6 kmph.\n\nIn the hint, it says \"consider the relationship\", and I did.\n\nMaybe \"rate against the current\" means something else, but standard interpretation is speed relative to ground when rowing against current.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, final answer should be B or E, but since they are identical, I'll choose B.\n\nBut in the options, E is also 6 kmph, so perhaps it's intentional.\n\nMaybe I misread the options. Let me check the question again.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA)15 kmph\n\nB)6 kmph\n\nC)12 kmph\n\nD)14 kmph\n\nE)6 kmph\n\nYes, B and E are the same.\n\nBut in multiple-choice questions, sometimes options repeat, but it's unusual.\n\nPerhaps the correct answer is listed twice to confuse, but I think it's fine.\n\nI should just output the letter corresponding to 6 kmph.\n\nBut which one? B is 6 kmph, E is also 6 kmph.\n\nMaybe the question is from a source where options are unique, but here they are not.\n\nBut based on reasoning, the answer is 6 kmph.\n\nPerhaps I need to see if there's any other interpretation.\n\nAnother thought: \"rate against the current\" might be misinterpreted, but no, standard is S - C.\n\nMaybe the still water speed is different, but it's given as 4 kmph.\n\nPerhaps the current speed is to be found differently.\n\nLet me denote:\n\nLet S be still water speed = 4 kmph.\n\nLet C be current speed.\n\nAgainst current: S - C = 2 kmph.\n\nSo, 4 - C = 2, C = 2 kmph.\n\nAlong current: S + C = 4 + 2 = 6 kmph.\n\nYes.\n\nNow, perhaps the options are meant to be different, but they are not.\n\nMaybe in the original question, option E is different, but here it's shown as 6 kmph.\n\nBut anyway, the answer is 6 kmph.\n\nI'll go with B, as it's the first option.\n\nBut to be precise, since the question might have a typo, but I have to choose from the given.\n\nPerhaps the hint is clear, and I should just output the answer.\n\nBut in the output, I need to put the letter.\n\nNow, in the example outputs, they always put the correct one.\n\nIn this case, both B and E are correct, but probably the question intends for E to be something else, but it's not.\n\nLooking back at the question, it's \"E)6 kmph\", same as B.\n\nBut in the list, B and E are both 6.\n\nPerhaps it's a mistake, but I'll assume that the answer is 6 kmph, and since B is listed, I'll use that.\n\nMaybe the question is to find the rate along the current, and I need to see the options.\n\nAnother way: perhaps \"rate against the current\" is given as 2 kmph, but maybe it's the speed of the current or something, but no, the hint clarifies.\n\nI think it's safe to say the answer is 6 kmph.\n\nNow, for the boxed answer, I need to choose one letter. Since B and E are identical, either is correct, but perhaps in standard multiple-choice, we pick the first one or something.\n\nBut to follow the instruction, I'll pick B.\n\nPerhaps the question has only one correct option, but here it's duplicated.\n\nBut based on the reasoning, the man's rate along the current is 6 kmph.\n\nSo, I'll go with that.\n</think>\nThe man's rowing speed in still water is 4 kmph.

For exactly five factors, this product must be 5, which is prime. Therefore, the prime factorization must consist of a single prime raised to the fourth power, i.e., Q = p^4 for some prime p.\n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime number. This would mean Q = q^2 for some prime q. However, p^4 = (p^2)^2, and p^2 is not prime unless p=1 (not prime), so Q is not the square of a prime.\n\nStatement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime number. This directly matches Q = p^4, so it is true.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers. This could be p*q with p and q prime. If p=q, Q=p^2 has three factors; if p≠q, Q=p*q has four factors. Neither case gives five factors, so it is not true.\n\nTherefore, only statement II must be true.\n\nThe correct option is C) II only.","full_output":"<think>\nFirst, the question is about a positive integer Q that has exactly five factors. I need to determine which of the statements must be true about Q.\n\nThe hint says to consider the prime factorization of Q. A number has exactly five factors if the product of one more than each of the exponents in its prime factorization equals five.\n\nSo, if Q has a prime factorization of \\( p_1^{a_1} p_2^{a_2} \\dots p_n^{a_n} \\), then the number of factors is given by \\((a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\dots (a_n + 1)\\).\n\nThis product must equal 5 for Q to have exactly five factors.\n\n5 is a prime number, so its factors are 1 and 5. Therefore, the product \\((a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \\dots (a_n + 1) = 5\\) implies that there must be only one exponent in the prime factorization, and that exponent plus one should be 5.\n\nLet me think: if there's only one prime factor, say \\( p^a \\), then the number of factors is \\( a + 1 \\).\n\nSo, \\( a + 1 = 5 \\), which means \\( a = 4 \\).\n\nSo, Q must be of the form \\( p^4 \\), where p is a prime number.\n\nNow, \\( p^4 \\) is the fourth power of a prime. For example, if p=2, Q=16, and factors of 16 are 1,2,4,8,16 – that's five factors. Yes.\n\nBut is this the only possibility? What if there are multiple prime factors?\n\nSuppose there are two prime factors, say \\( p^a q^b \\), then the number of factors is (a+1)(b+1).\n\nThis product must be 5. But 5 is prime, so the only way to write it as a product of two integers greater than 1 is 5=5*1, but since exponents are non-negative integers, a+1 and b+1 must be at least 1, but if one is 1, say b+1=1, then b=0, which means no second prime factor. So, it has to be only one prime factor.\n\nMore precisely, (a+1)(b+1)=5. Since a+1 and b+1 are integers greater than or equal to 1, and their product is 5, the possible pairs are (1,5), (5,1), and (5,1) is the same as (1,5) in terms of exponents.\n\nIf a+1=1, then a=0, which means no first prime factor.\n\nIf a+1=5, then a=4, and b+1=1, so b=0, meaning only one prime factor.\n\nSimilarly, if there are three or more prime factors, the product (a+1)(b+1)(c+1) would be at least 2*2*2=8 if all exponents are at least 1, but 8 > 5, and even if some exponents are 0, it doesn't make sense because exponents are for the primes present.\n\nThe hint says \"the product of one more than each of the exponents\", so for each prime in the factorization, we have an exponent, and we add one to each and multiply.\n\nBut if a prime is not present, its exponent is 0, and 0+1=1, but then including extra primes with exponent 0 would multiply by 1, which doesn't change the product, but it's not standard to include primes not in the factorization.\n\nIn the formula for number of factors, we only consider the primes that are actually in the factorization. So, for example, if Q is prime, say 5, then factors are 1 and 5, so two factors. But here, we need exactly five factors.\n\nSo, back to the point: for the product to be 5, and since 5 is prime, the only way is to have one exponent a such that a+1=5, so a=4, and no other primes.\n\nIf we have multiple exponents, but the product is 5, which is prime, so it must be that there is only one non-zero exponent, and it is 4.\n\nCould we have a prime factor with exponent 0? No, because that would not be part of the factorization.\n\nSo, Q must be \\( p^4 \\) for some prime p.\n\nNow, let's look at the statements:\n\nI. Q is the square of a prime number.\n\nA square of a prime would be \\( p^2 \\), which has factors: 1, p, p^2. So three factors. But we need five factors, so this is not true. For example, if p=2, Q=4, factors are 1,2,4 – only three.\n\nII. Q is the fourth power of a prime number.\n\nFourth power of prime is \\( p^4 \\), which as we saw, has five factors. So this seems true.\n\nIII. Q is the product of two prime numbers.\n\nProduct of two prime numbers could be two cases: if both primes are same, say p*q with p=q, then it's p^2, which has three factors.\n\nIf different primes, say p and q distinct, then factors are 1, p, q, p*q. So four factors.\n\nBut we need five factors, so neither case gives five factors. For example, p*q with p=q, like 4, has three factors; with p≠q, like 6, factors are 1,2,3,6 – four factors.\n\nSo, none of these give five factors.\n\nBut according to my earlier reasoning, Q must be p^4, which is the fourth power.\n\nNow, is p^4 always the square of a prime? No, p^4 is (p^2)^2, so it's the square of p^2, but p^2 is not prime unless p= prime, but p^2 is composite for p>1.\n\nThe statement I says \"Q is the square of a prime number\". So, if Q is p^4, is it the square of a prime? p^4 = (p^2)^2, but p^2 is not prime (for p>1), so no. For example, 16 is square of 4, but 4 is not prime.\n\nUnless p^2 is prime, but p^2 is prime only if p= prime and p^2 prime, but squares of primes are never prime except for p=1, but 1 is not prime. So, p^4 is not the square of a prime.\n\nStatement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime. Yes, p^4 is exactly that.\n\nStatement III: Product of two prime numbers. p^4 is not a product of two primes, unless it's p*p*p*p, but that's four primes, not two.\n\nSo, only statement II seems correct.\n\nBut let me double-check.\n\nIs there any other way a number can have exactly five factors?\n\nSuppose Q is p^4, as above.\n\nCould Q be something else? For example, if it has two prime factors, but exponents such that (a+1)(b+1)=5.\n\nBut 5 is prime, so the only factorizations are 5=5*1 or 1*5, which requires one exponent to be 4 and the other to be 0, but exponent 0 means no prime factor, so it's not two primes.\n\nIf we consider more than one prime, but with exponents that make the product 5.\n\nBut 5 is prime, so the product must be a prime number, meaning only one factor in the product, so only one prime factor with exponent 4.\n\nAnother way: could Q be a prime power with exponent 4, yes.\n\nBut is there a number that is not a prime power but still has five factors? For example, if it's p^4, but what if it's p^2 * q^2 or something? No.\n\np^2 * q^2 would have (2+1)(2+1)=3*3=9 factors.\n\nOr p^3 * q, would have (3+1)(1+1)=4*2=8 factors.\n\nNone of these give five.\n\nWhat about p^4 itself.\n\nBut let me confirm with an example.\n\nTake Q=16, which is 2^4. Factors: 1,2,4,8,16. Yes, five.\n\nIs it the square of a prime? 16 is 4^2, but 4 is not prime. Or 2^4 is not a square of a prime unless the prime is 2, but (2)^2=4, not 16. 16 is 4^2, and 4 is composite.\n\nSo, not a square of a prime.\n\nIs it the fourth power of a prime? 2^4=16, yes, so it is.\n\nIs it product of two primes? 16=2*8, but 8 is not prime. Or 4*4, but 4 is not prime. No.\n\nAnother example, say Q=81, which is 3^4. Factors: 1,3,9,27,81. Five factors.\n\nSquare of a prime? 81=9^2, 9 is not prime. Or\n\n<think>\nThe number of factors is given by the product of one more than each exponent in the prime factorization. For exactly five factors, this product must be 5, which is prime. Therefore, the prime factorization must consist of a single prime raised to the fourth power, i.e., Q = p^4 for some prime p.\n\nStatement I: Q is the square of a prime number. This would mean Q = q^2 for some prime q. However, p^4 = (p^2)^2, and p^2 is not prime unless p=1 (not prime), so Q is not the square of a prime.\n\nStatement II: Q is the fourth power of a prime number. This directly matches Q = p^4, so it is true.\n\nStatement III: Q is the product of two prime numbers. This could be p*q with p and q prime. If p=q, Q=p^2 has three factors; if p≠q, Q=p*q has four factors. Neither case gives five factors, so it is not true.\n\nTherefore, only statement II must be true.\n\nThe correct option is C) II only.\n</think>\n\\boxed{C}","ground_truth":"B","predicted_answer":"C","is_correct":false,"was_retried":true}

The binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{5}{4} = 5\\) gives the number of ways to choose which four voters voted. The probability is calculated as \\(\\binom{5}{4} \\times p^4 \\times q^1 = 5 \\times (0.9)^4 \\times 0.1\\). First, \\((0.9)^4 = 0.6561\\), then \\(0.6561 \\times 0.1 = 0.06561\\), and finally \\(5 \\times 0.06561 = 0.32805\\). Converting to percentage: \\(0.32805 \\times 100 = 32.805\\%\\), which approximates to 32.8%. This matches option B.\n\n\\boxed{B}","ground_truth":"E","predicted_answer":"B","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}
