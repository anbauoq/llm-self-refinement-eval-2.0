Each sale is $250. So, the commission per sale is 10% of $250.\n\nLet me calculate that: 10% of 250 is (10/100) * 250 = 0.1 * 250 = 25. So, he makes $25 commission per sale.\n\nNow, he wants to reach a salary of at least $1000. The question says \"salary,\" but it might be referring to his commission-based income. I'll assume that the salary is solely based on the commission from sales.\n\nSo, he needs his total commission to be at least $1000.\n\nLet the number of sales be n.\n\nThen, total commission = commission per sale * n = 25 * n.\n\nWe need 25 * n ≥ 1000.\n\nNow, solve for n: n ≥ 1000 / 25.\n\n1000 divided by 25 is 40.\n\nSo, n ≥ 40.\n\nHe must make at least 40 sales.\n\nNow, looking at\n\n<think>\nThe salesperson makes a 10% commission on each $250 sale, so $25 per sale.\n\nTo reach a salary of at least $1000, the total commission must be at least $1000.\n\nLet n be the number of sales.\n\n25 * n ≥ 1000\n\nn ≥ 1000 / 25\n\nn ≥ 40\n\nSince n must be an integer, and the inequality is at least, the minimum n is 40.\n\nNow, check the options: A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52.\n\n40 is option D.\n\nIs there any trick here? The question says \"salary,\" but in the context, it's likely the commission-based salary. Also, it doesn't mention any base salary, so I think we're to assume that the salary is the commission itself.\n\nSo, with 40 sales, commission is 40 * 25 = $1000, which is exactly $1000, and since it's at least, 40 is correct.\n\nIf he makes 39 sales, 39\n\n<think>\nThe salesperson gets a 10% commission on each $250 sale, so commission per sale is $25.\n\nTo reach a salary of at least $1000, the total commission must be at least $1000.\n\nLet n be the number of sales. Then, 25n ≥ 1000.\n\nSolve for n: n ≥ 1000 / 25 = 40.\n\nSince n must be an integer, the minimum n is 40.\n\nNow, looking at the options: A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52.\n\nOption D is 40.\n\nIs 40 the smallest integer that satisfies the condition? Yes, because 39 * 25 = $975, which is less than $1000, and 40 * 25 = $1000, which meets the requirement.\n\nThe question says \"at least $1000,\" so $1000 is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n</think>\n\\boxed{D}","ground_truth":"D","predicted_answer":"D","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

Let's assume the wholesale cost is W. Then, the original retail price is 60% more than W, so retail price R = W + 0.6W = 1.6W.\n\nThe appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price. So, the selling price S = R - 0.2R = 0.8R.\n\nSubstitute R: S = 0.8 * 1.6W = 1.28W.\n\nNow, S is 1.28W, which means it's sold for 128% of the wholesale cost. But the question is asking for what percent more than its wholesale cost. So, 128% minus 100% is 28%, meaning it was sold for 28% more than the wholesale cost.\n\nLet me double-check.

So, the new man's weight minus 53 kg equals 18 kg.\n\nTherefore, new weight = 53 + 18 = 71 kg.\n\nThe correct answer is option A.","full_output":"<think>\nFirst, the average weight of 10 oarsmen increases by 1.8 kg when one oarsman weighing 53 kg is replaced by a new man. I need to find the weight of the new man.\n\nThe average weight increase means the total weight of the oarsmen increases. Since there are 10 oarsmen, the increase in average weight is due to the replacement.\n\nLet the original average weight be A kg. So, the original total weight is 10A kg.\n\nAfter replacing the 53 kg oarsman with a new man of weight N kg, the new total weight is 10A - 53 + N kg.\n\nThe new average weight is (10A - 53 + N)/10 kg.\n\nAccording to the problem, the new average is A + 1.8 kg.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation:\n\n(10A - 53 + N)/10 = A + 1.8\n\nNow, solve for N.\n\nMultiply both sides by 10 to eliminate the denominator:\n\n10A - 53 + N = 10 * (A + 1.8)\n\nWhich is:\n\n10A\n\n<think>\nI need to find the weight of the new man. The average weight increases by 1.8 kg for 10 oarsmen, so the total increase in weight is 10 times the increase in average. That means the total weight increases by 10 * 1.8 = 18 kg.\n\nThis total increase is because one oarsman weighing 53 kg is replaced by a new man. So, the difference between the new man's weight and the old one is 18 kg. Since the average increases, the new man must be heavier than the one he replaced.\n\nSo, N - 53 = 18\n\nTherefore, N = 53 + 18 = 71 kg.\n\nNow, looking at the options, A is 71 kg.\n\nI should verify this.
