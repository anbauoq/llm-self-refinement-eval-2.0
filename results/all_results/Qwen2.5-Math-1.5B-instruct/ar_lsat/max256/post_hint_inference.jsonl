The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.\n\nWhich one of the following CANNOT be true?\nA) Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.\nB) Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.\nC) Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.\nD) Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.\nE) Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.","full_output":"You are a helpful assistant.

Since Sara's oil is in the lower position of wall 4, her watercolor must be on one of the other walls.\n\nNext, consider green's watercolor. It is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. This means green's oil must be on one of the other walls.\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible positions for each student:\n\n1. ** green's watercolor is on wall 1.**\n   - Then, green's oil is on wall 2 or 3.\n   - If green's oil is on wall 2, then green's watercolor is on wall","chain_of_thought":"You are a helpful assistant.
