Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the constraints:**\n   - Each student works exactly two shifts.\n   - No student works both shifts of any day.\n   - On two consecutive days, Louise works the second shift.\n   - On two nonconsecutive days, Grecia works the first shift.\n   - Katya works on Tuesday and Friday.\n   - Hakeem and Joe work on the same day as each other at least once.\n   - Grecia and Louise never work on the same day as each other.\n\n2. **Assign the known information:**\n   - Katya works the second shift on Tuesday.\n   - Katya works the second shift on Friday.\n   - Therefore, Katya works the first shift on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday.\n\n3. **Determine the shifts for other students:**\n   - Louise works the second shift on two consecutive days. Since Katya works the second shift on Tuesday and Friday, Louise must work the second shift on Monday and Thursday.\n   - This leaves the first shift for the other students on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday\n\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the possible shifts for each student based on the given constraints. Let's start by listing the shifts for Katya and Louise:\n\n- Katya: First shift on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday; Second shift on Tuesday and Friday.\n- Louise: First shift on Monday and Thursday; Second shift on Tuesday and Friday.\n\nNext, we need to assign the shifts for Grecia, Hakeem, and Joe. We know the following:\n\n- Grecia works the first shift on two days (since Grecia works the first shift on two days, and Katya works the first shift on Monday, Grecia cannot work on Monday).\n- Grecia does not work the same day as Louise, so Grecia cannot work the first shift on Monday (since Louise works the first shift on Monday).\n- Therefore, Grecia must work the first shift on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nNow, we know:\n- Grecia: First shift on Wednesday and Thursday; Second shift on Monday and Friday.\n- Louise: First shift on Monday and Thursday; Second shift on Tuesday and Friday.\n- Katya: First shift on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday; Second shift on Tuesday and Friday.\n\nThis leaves the shifts\n\nThe correct answer is \\boxed{E}.**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**\\n**","ground_truth":"B","predicted_answer":"E","is_correct":false,"was_retried":true}
