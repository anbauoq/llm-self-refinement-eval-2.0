House A can be blue because it only cannot be red. Then House B cannot be blue, so it must be red or green; take B = red, which forces House C = green since colors can't repeat and C is green or blue. This gives A = blue, B = red, C = green, but that exact assignment isn't listed, so pick the option that matches it as closely as possible.
