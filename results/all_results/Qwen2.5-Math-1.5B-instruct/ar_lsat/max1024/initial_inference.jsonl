The bank wants to predict the default of loan stricter based on several factors. You have been given a dataset with the following columns: `loan_amount`, `loan_term`, `roots`, `age`, `default` (where `default = 1` if the loan default, `default = 0` if the loan does not default). The dataset contains 1000 observations.\n\n1. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the `loan_amount` column.\n2. Calculate the correlation coefficient between `loan_amount` and `default`.\n3.

Calculate the coefficient of determination (R-squared) of the linear regression model.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the dataset and performing the required calculations and visualizations.\n\n1. **Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the `loan_amount` column:**\n   - Mean: The mean of a column is the sum of all values divided by the number of values.\n   - Standard Deviation: The standard deviation measures the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. It is calculated as the square root of the variance.\n\n2. **Calculate the correlation coefficient between `loan_amount` and `default`:**\n   - The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables.

Let's denote the testing pattern for the first day as follows:\n\n| R identities | Bicycles |\n| --- | --- |\n| Reynaldo | \\( R_1 \\) |\n| Seaysus | \\( S_1 \\) |\n| Theresa | \\( T_1 = J \\) |\n| Yuki | \\( Y_1 \\) |\n\nAnd for the second day:\n\n| R identities | Bicycles |\n| --- | --- |\n| Reynaldo | \\( R_2 \\) |\n| Seaysus | \\( S_2 \\) |\n| Theresa | \\( T_2 \\) |\n| Yuki | \\( Y_2 = S_1 \\) |\n\n### Step 4: Determine the testing pattern for the second day\nSince Theresa tests J on the first day, she must test either H or K on the second day. However, since Theresa must be one of the testers for H, she cannot test H on the second day. Therefore, Theresa must test K on the second day. This means Yuki must test H on the second day because Yuki cannot test J and the only remaining bicycle for Yuki is H.\n\nSo, the testing pattern for the second day is:\n\n| R identities | Bicycles |\n| --- | --- |\n| Reynaldo | \\( R_2 \\) |\n| Seaysus | \\( S_2 \\) |\n| Theresa | \\( T_2 = K \\) |\n| Yuki | \\( Y_2 = H \\) |\n\n### Step 5: Determine the testing pattern for the first day\nNow, we need to determine the testing pattern for the first day. Since Theresa tests J on the first day, she cannot test J on the second day. Therefore, Theresa must test K on the second day, which means she tested K on the first day. This leaves Yuki to test H on the first day because Yuki cannot test J and the only remaining bicycle for Yuki is H. This leavesReynaldo to test G on the first day because Reynaldo cannot test F and the only remaining bicycle for Reynaldo is G.\n\nSo, the testing pattern for the first day is:\n\n| R identities | Bicycles |\n| --- | --- |\n| Reynaldo | \\( R_1 = G \\) |\n| Seaysus | \\( S_1 = H \\) |\n| Theresa | \\( T_1 = J \\) |\n| Yuki | \\( Y_1 = K \\) |\n\n### Step 6: Verify the solution\nLet's verify the solution:\n- Theresa tests J on the first day, so she must test K on the second day.\n- Yuki tests K on the second day, so he must test H on the first day.\n- Theresa tests J on the first day, so she tested K on the first day.\n- Yuki tests K on the first day, so he tested H on the second day.\n- Theresa tests J on the second day, so she tested K on the first day.\n- Yuki tests K on the first day, so he tested H on the second day.\n- Theresa tests J on the first day, so she tested K on the first day.\n- Yuki tests K on the first day, so he tested H on the second day.\n- Theresa tests J on the first day, so she tested K on the first day.\n- Yuki tests K on the first day, so he tested H on the second day.\n\nThis solution satisfies all the conditions given in the problem. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{C}","ground_truth":"B","predicted_answer":"C","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\n**Scenario 3: T is in Zone 2**\n- Then P cannot be in Zone 1 (from condition 1), so P must be in Zone 3.\n- Q must be in the same zone as P, so Q is in Zone 3.\n- S and B are in the same zone, so S must be in Zone 2, which is already taken by T.\n- This means S must be in Zone 3.\n- Now we have P in Zone 3, Q in Zone 3, T in Zone 2, and S in Zone 3.\n- Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, M and T must be in Zone 2.\n- This means T is in Zone 2, which is already taken by T. Therefore, this scenario is not possible.\n\nAfter analyzing all possible scenarios, we can conclude that the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{C}","ground_truth":"A","predicted_answer":"C","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

This implies that if Knutson is assigned to the vertical univesity ceremony, then Heideck and Mays can be assigned to either ceremony.\n\nNow, let's analyze the options:\n\n- **Option A: frost, Heideck** - This is a possible assignment because frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the committees.\n- **Option B: frost, Heideck, Knutson** - This is not a possible assignment because if Knutson is assigned to the vertical univesity ceremony, then Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it, which would mean more than two photographer are assigned to the vertical univesity committee.\n- **Option C: frost, Heideck, Knutson, Lai** - This is not a possible assignment because if Lai is assigned to the vertical univesity committee, then Mays must be assigned to the horizontal univesity committee, which means more than two photographer are assigned to the vertical univesity committee.\n- **Option D: frost, knowledge, Heideck** - This is a possible assignment because frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the committees, and knowledge can be assigned to either committee.\n- **Option E: frost, knowledge, Heideck, Mays** - This is not a possible assignment because if knowledge is assigned to the vertical univesity committee, then Lai must be assigned to the horizontal univesity committee, which means more than two photographer are assigned to the vertical univesity committee.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{D}.","ground_truth":"B","predicted_answer":"D","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

This means Grecia works the first shift on Wednesday if Joe and Hakeem work on Thursday, and Grecia works the first shift on Thursday if Joe and Hakeem work on Wednesday.\n\n4. **Determine the shifts for Louise:**\n   - Louise works the second shift on Monday and Tuesday, as determined earlier.\n\n5. **Construct the schedule:**\n   - If Joe and Hakeem work on the same day on Thursday, then Joe works the first shift on Thursday and Hakeem works the second shift on Thursday. This means Grecia works the first shift on Wednesday. The schedule would be:\n     - Monday: Louise (second shift)\n     - Tuesday: Louise (second shift), Katya (first shift)\n     - Wednesday: Joe (first shift), Grecia (second shift)\n     - Thursday: Hakeem (first shift), Joe (second shift)\n     - Friday: Katya (first shift), Louise (second shift)\n   - If Joe and Hakeem work on the same day on Wednesday, then Joe works the first shift on Wednesday and Hakeem works the second shift on Wednesday. This means Grecia works the first shift on Thursday. The schedule would be:\n     - Monday: Louise (second shift)\n     - Tuesday: Katya (first shift), Louise (second shift)\n     - Wednesday: Joe (first shift), Hakeem (second shift)\n     - Thursday: Grecia (first shift), Joe (second shift)\n     - Friday: Katya (first shift), Louise (second shift)\n\n6. **Check the options:**\n   - Option A: Hakeem, Louise, Louise, Hakeem, Katya (This is not possible because Hakeem and Louise cannot work on the same day as each other at the same time.)\n   - Option B: Joe, Hakeem, Grecia, Louise, Louise (This is not possible because Grecia and Louise cannot work on the same day as each other.)\n   - Option C: Joe, Katya, Hakeem, Louise, Katya (This is not possible because Katya works on Tuesday and Friday, and the schedule does not match.)\n   - Option D: Louise, Katya, Joe, Louise, Katya (This is not possible because Katya works on Tuesday and Friday, and the schedule does not match.)\n   - Option E: Louise, Louise, Hakeem, Joe, Joe (This is not possible because Hakeem and Joe cannot work on the same day as each other at the same time.)\n\nThe correct schedule is the one where Joe and Hakeem work on the same day on Wednesday, and Grecia works the first shift on Thursday.

Since Quinn is not leading, this option is invalid.\n   - **Option C: Verma ( leader), Smith, Taylor**\n     - Smith is a project member, so Taylor must also be. This satisfies the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. However, if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be, but Wells is not a project member in this option. So, this option is valid.\n   - **Option D: Verma ( leader), Smith, Xue**\n     - Smith is a project member, so Taylor must also be. This satisfies the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. However, if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be, but Wells is not a project member in this option. So, this option is valid.\n   - **Option E: Xue ( leader), Verma, Wells**\n     - Wells is a project member, so neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. However, Verma is a project member in this option, so this option is invalid.\n\n3. **Conclusion:**\n   - Both options C and D satisfy all the constraints. However, the problem asks for \"the following acceptable selection,\" which implies a single correct answer. Given the problem's structure, we should select the first valid option that meets all constraints, which is option C.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{C}.","ground_truth":"C","predicted_answer":"C","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

The harmonicica and the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 1st because the sundial is auctioned on June 1st. So, the harmonicica must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, and the lamp must be auctioned on the other day. The mirror must be auctioned on the remaining day. This means the harmonicica and the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 3rd if the table is auctioned on June 4th. So, the harmonicica must be auctioned on June 3rd, the lamp on June 2nd, and the mirror on June 1st. This means the harmonicica is not auctioned on June 3rd, so the harmonicica cannot be auctioned on June 3rd if the table is auctioned on June 4th.\n   - If the vase is auctioned on June 5th, the table must be auctioned on June 6th.

This means the harmonicica and the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 3rd if the table is auctioned on June 5th. So, the harmonicica must be auctioned on June 3rd, the lamp on June 2nd, and the mirror on June 1st. This means the harmonicica is not auctioned on June 3rd, so the harmonicica cannot be auctioned on June 3rd if the table is auctioned on June 5th.\n   - If the vase is auctioned on June 6th, the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.

Therefore, wall 4 must have one oil and one watercolor.\n\n2. **Determine the positions of green's watercolor:**\n   - green's watercolor is on the same wall as Franz's oil, but it is in the upper position. Since green's watercolor is on the same wall as Franz's oil, and green's watercolor is in the upper position, green's oil must be on a different wall.\n\n3. **Determine the positions of H identify the walls for each student:**\n   - Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, each wall must have at least one oil and one watercolor.\n   - Since no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, each wall must have at least one oil and one watercolor from different students.\n   - Since no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Samacs displayed on it, each wall must have one painting by either H or J, and one painting by either G or S.\n\n### Possible Arrangements:\n1. ** wall 1: H's oil, J's watercolor**\n2. ** wall 2: G's oil, S's watercolor**\n3. ** wall 3: H's oil, J's watercolor**\n4. ** wall 4: S's oil, G's watercolor**\n\n### Check Each Statement:\n1. ** A) Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as green's oil.**\n   - This is possible. green's oil is on wall 4, and H's oil is also on wall 4.\n   \n2. ** B) H identify the walls for each student:**\n   - This is possible. H's oil is on wall 1 or wall 3, and J's watercolor is on wall 1 or wall 3.\n   \n3. ** C) green's oil is displayed in an upper position.**\n   - This is possible. green's oil is on wall 4, and it is in the upper position.\n   \n4. ** D) H identify the walls for each student:**\n   - This is possible. H's oil is on wall 1 or wall 3, and J's watercolor is on wall 1 or wall 3.\n   \n5. ** E) Samacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as H identify the walls for each student:**\n   - This is not possible. Samacs's watercolor is on wall 4, and H's oil is on wall 1 or wall 3.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe statement that cannot be true is:\n\n\\boxed{E}","ground_truth":"D","predicted_answer":"E","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yvonne House (class 3), and the Kedron House (class 3). Southco owns the Yvonne House (class 1) and the Zvonne House (class 2). array owns the Xvne House, the Yvonne House, and the Zvonne House, all of which are class 2.

The trades are:\n1. trading one building for one other building of the same class\n2. trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings\n3. trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings\n\nGiven that RealProp owns only class 2 buildings after some trades, let's analyze the options:\n\n**Option A: array owns a class 1 building.**\n- Since RealProp only has class 2 buildings, it must have traded away its class 1 building (Garza Tower), so it must trade away its class 3 buildings (Yvonne House and another one).\n\nThis means the class 3 building that RealProp trades away must be traded for class 2 buildings.

Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yvonne House (class 3), and the Kedron House (class 3).
