The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, so the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on one of the other days (M, W, or F). Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.

Since \\( O \\) also does not review any of the plays that \\( K \\) and \\( L \\) review, \\( O \\) must review the other play that \\( J \\) does not review.\n\n### Step 4: Verify the conditions\n- \\( K \\) and \\( L \\) each review one play, and \\( M \\) reviews two plays.\n- \\( J \\) and \\( O \\) each review one play, and they review different plays.\n- \\( K \\) and \\( L \\) each review fewer plays than \\( M \\).\n- \\( K \\) and \\( L \\) both review T America.\n- \\( J \\) and \\( O \\) do not review any plays that \\( K \\) and \\( L \\) review.\n- Exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we can see that \\( K \\) and \\( L \\) each review T America, and \\( M \\) reviews bothcosm and undulation. Therefore, \\( J \\) and \\( O \\) must each review eithercosm or undulation.\n\nThe only way to satisfy all conditions is if \\( J \\) and \\( O \\) each review one of the remaining plays. Since \\( J \\) and \\( O \\) do not review any plays that \\( K \\) and \\( L \\) review, and they must each review one play, the only possible arrangement is that \\( J \\) reviews undulation and \\( O \\) reviewscosm.\n\nSo, the students who review onlycosm are \\( O \\).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{E}\\).","ground_truth":"A","predicted_answer":"E","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

Therefore, Xu can be assigned #4, #5, or #6, and Sozeta can be assigned #1, #2, or #3.\n\nGiven these assignments, we can now determine the possible assignments for the remaining employees. Since Robert is assigned #3, Young is assigned #2, and Togollu is assigned #1, the remaining employees aremathrm{Sozeta,agon, and Xu}.\n\nSince Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Sozeta, and Sozeta can be assigned #1, #2, or #3, Xu can be assigned #4, #5, or #6. Therefore, Xu can be assigned #4, #5, or #6, and Sozeta can be assigned #1, #2, or #3.\n\nSincemathrm{Xu} andmathrm{Sozeta} must be assigned different parking spaces, andmathrm{Xu} can be assigned #4, #5, or #6, andmathrm{Sozeta} can be assigned #1, #2, or #3, the only possible assignments are:\n-mathrm{Xu} assigned #4,mathrm{Sozeta} assigned #3,mathrm{agone} assigned #5,mathrm{Sozeta} assigned #6.\n\nTherefore, the only statement that must be true is thatmathrm{Xu} is assigned parking space #6.\n\nThe answer is \\boxed{D}.","ground_truth":"E","predicted_answer":"D","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\n\nWhich one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that if Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne, would have the same effect in determining the assignment of the ambassadors?\nA) If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramillo.\nB) If Landon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Novetzke.\nC) If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.\nD) Jaramillo and Novetzke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.\nE) Novetzke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.","chain_of_thought":"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given constraints and determine which one would have the same effect as the constraint \"If Jaramultip is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.\"\n\nLet's break down the original constraint and the options:\n\n1. **Original Constraint**: If Jaramultip is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.\n2. **Option A**: If Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, then so is Jaramultip.\n3. **Option B**: If Llandon and Ong are both assigned to ambassadorships, then so is Nov8ke.\n4. **Option C**: If Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship.\n5. **Option D**: Jaramultip and Nov8ke are not both assigned to ambassadorships.\n6. **Option E**: Nov8ke and Ong are not both assigned to ambassadorships.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n- **Option A**: This is the converse of the original constraint.

This means the bottom shelf has 3 books (F, M, and one more book).\n   - K is on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top or middle shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, K must be on the top shelf.\n   - O is on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top or middle shelf, and L must be on the bottom or middle shelf. Since K is on the top shelf, O must be on the top shelf, and L must be on the bottom shelf.\n   - The remaining books are G and H. Since the top shelf has K and O, and the middle shelf has I, the top shelf must have K and O, and the middle shelf must have I. This leaves G and H for the bottom shelf.\n\n4. **Verify the arrangement:**\n   - Top shelf: K, O\n   - Middle shelf: I\n   - Bottom shelf: F, M, G, H\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions:\n- More books are on the bottom shelf (4 books) than on the top shelf (2 books).\n- I is on the middle shelf.\n- K is on a higher shelf than F (K is on the top shelf, F is on the bottom shelf).\n- O is on a higher shelf than L (O is on the top shelf, L is on the bottom shelf).\n- F is on the same shelf as M (both are on the bottom shelf).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{D}\\).","ground_truth":"B","predicted_answer":"D","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

Since Kevin and Rebecca are leading Thursday sessions, Julia and Rebecca must be leading Wednesday's morning session and Thursday's morning session, but we already know Kevin and Rebecca are leading Thursday sessions, so Julia and Rebecca must be leading Wednesday's morning session and Thursday's morning session, but we already know Kevin and Rebecca are leading Thursday sessions, so Julia and Rebecca must be leading Wednesday's morning session and Thursday's morning session.\n\n4. **Count the number of lab assistants whose sessions can be determined:**\n   - We know Julio is leading the Thursday afternoon session.\n   - We know Kevin and Rebecca are leading the Thursday sessions (one morning and one afternoon).\n   - We know Nessa is leading the Wednesday afternoon session.\n   - We know Lan and Olivia are leading the Friday afternoon session.\n   - We know Julia and Rebecca are leading the Wednesday morning session.\n\nSo, we can determine the sessions for Julio, Kevin, Rebecca, Nessa, Lan, Olivia, Julia, and Rebecca. However, since we only need to count the number of lab assistants whose sessions can be determined, we can see that we can determine the sessions for Kevin, Rebecca, Nessa, and Julia, which is 4 lab assistants.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{D}\\).","ground_truth":"C","predicted_answer":"D","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

The toy store cannot be in space 4, 5, or 6, so it must be in space 4 or 5.\n\nSince the opt geometrist is next to the pharmacy, the only possible arrangement that fits all the constraints is: 1 (pharmacy), 2 (opt geometrist), 3 (restaurant), 4 (toy store), 5 (shoe store), 6 (shoe store), 7 (Shoes store).\n\nTherefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the opt geometrist pair must be the pharmacy and the toy store.\n\nThe answer is: \\boxed{B}","ground_truth":"D","predicted_answer":"B","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

Let's consider the correct placement of the correct schedule again.\n\n### Correct placement:\n- The correct schedule must be:\n  - screen 1: Horiciency, mystery\n  - Screen 2: Science fiction, romance\n  - Screen 3: Western\n\nGiven this schedule, the correct answer is:\n- The correct answer is that the science fiction and romance are on the same screen, which means the correct answer is that the science fiction and romance are on the same screen.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{E}\\).","ground_truth":"A","predicted_answer":"E","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}
