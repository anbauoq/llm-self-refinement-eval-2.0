First, we convert 70 minutes into hours and minutes:\n\n\\[ 70 \\text{ minutes} = 1 \\text{ hour and } 10 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, if it is 4:12 p.m., adding 1 hour and 10 minutes will give us the time her mom will get home:\n\n\\[ 4:12 \\text{ p.m.} + 1 \\text{ hour} = 5:12 \\text{ p.m.} \\]\n\\[ 5:12 \\text{ p.m.} + 10 \\text{ minutes} = 5:22 \\text{ p.m.} \\]\n\nNow, we know that the gymnastics lessons start at 6:00 p.m. We need to find the difference between 5:22 p.m. and 6:00 p.m.:\n\n\\[ 6:00 \\text{ p.m.} - 5:22 \\text{ p.m.} = 38 \\text{ minutes} \\]\n\nSo, Emma will have 38 minutes between the time her mom gets home from work and the beginning of her gymnastics lessons.

Determine how many packages of Sweettarts Stephen bought.\n2. Calculate the total number of Sweettarts Stephen ate.\n3. Subtract the number of Sweettarts Stephen ate from the total number of Sweettarts he bought.\n\nFirst, we need to find out how many packages of Sweettarts Stephen bought. Since each package contains 7 Sweettarts and Stephen ate 64 Sweettarts, we divide 64 by 7 to find out how many full packages he bought and how many extra Sweettarts he ate from the last package.\n\n\\[ 64 \\div 7 = 9 \\text{ R } 1 \\]\n\nThis means Stephen bought 9 full packages and ate 1 more Sweetgy from the 10th package. So, the total number of Sweettarts he ate is 64.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many packages he bought in total. Since each package contains 7 Sweettarts, the total number of Sweettarts he bought is:\n\n\\[ 9 \\text{ packages} \\times 7 \\text{ Sweettarts per package} + 1 \\text{ extra Sweetgy} = 63 + 1 = 64 \\text{ Sweettarts} \\]\n\nSince Stephen ate all 64 Sweettarts, the number of Sweettarts he has left is:\n\n\\[ 64 - 64 = 0 \\]\n\nSo, the number of Sweettarts Stephen has left is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).","ground_truth":"1","predicted_answer":"0","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

Subtract the number of candies Shirley ate from the total number of candies she initially had.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many packages of candies Shirley ate. Since each package contains 4 candies and Shirley ate 10 candies, we divide 10 by 4:\n\n\\[ \\frac{10}{4} = 2.5 \\]\n\nThis means Shirley ate 2.5 packages of candies.
