How much did she earn?\n <th> step-by-step reasoning</th>\n <ans> Weng earns $12 for 60 minutes of work. She worked 50 minutes, which is 50/60 of an hour. Her earnings are 12 * (50/60) = 12 * (5/6) = 10</ans>\n <ans>10</ans>\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?\n <th> step-by-step reasoning</th>\n <ans> Betty costs $100, and Betty already has half of that, so she has $50. Her parents give her $15, and her grandparents give twice that, which is 2 * 15 = $30. So in total she has 50 + 15 + 30 = $95.

The remaining pages are 120 - 24 = 96. She wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, so she should read 96 / 2 = 48 pages</ans>\n <ans>48</ans>\n\nExample 5:\nQuestion: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week.

{"id":728,"question":"A box can hold 18 pieces of chalk. If there are 3,484 pieces of chalk, how many boxes are full to hold all the chalk?","chain_of_thought":"To determine how many full boxes are needed to hold all 3,484 pieces of chalk, we start by dividing the total number of pieces of chalk by the capacity of each box. Each box can hold 18 pieces of chalk.\n\nFirst, we perform the division:\n\n\\[ 3484 \\div 18 \\]\n\nUsing long division, we break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Divide the first two digits of the dividend by the divisor:**\n   - 34 divided by 18 is 1 (since 18 goes into 34 once).\n   - Multiply 18 by 1 to get 18.\n   - Subtract 18 from 34 to get a remainder of 16.\n\n2. **Bring down the next digit:**\n   - Bring down the next digit, which is 8, to make it 168.\n   - Divide 168 by 18. 18 goes into 168 nine times (since 18 times 9 is 162).\n   - Multiply 18 by 9 to get 162.\n   - Subtract 162 from 168 to get a remainder of 6.\n\n3. **Bring down the next digit:**\n   - Bring down the next digit, which is 4, to make it 64.\n   - Divide 64 by 18. 18 goes into 64 three times (since 18 times 3 is 54).\n   - Multiply 18 by 3 to get 54.\n   - Subtract 54 from 64 to get a remainder of 10.\n\nSo, the quotient is 193 with a remainder of 10. This means that 193 boxes are completely full, and there are 10 pieces of chalk left over that would need to be placed in another box. Since we are asked for the number of full boxes, we do not count the 10 pieces of chalk that are not enough to fill another box.\n\nTherefore, the number of full boxes needed is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{193} \\]","full_output":"To determine how many full boxes are needed to hold all 3,484 pieces of chalk, we start by dividing the total number of pieces of chalk by the capacity of each box.

We can express this as:\n   \\[\n   4G + 5P = 1500\n   \\]\n   Substituting the value of \\( G \\) (which is 200 grams) into the equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   4(200) + 5P = 1500\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   800 + 5P = 1500\n   \\]\n   Subtract 800 from both sides to isolate the term with \\( P \\):\n   \\[\n   5P = 700\n   \\]\n   Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \\( P \\):\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{700}{5} = 140 \\text{ grams}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Find the difference between the weight of one glass bottle and one plastic bottle:**\n   \\[\n   G - P = 200 - 140 = 60 \\text{ grams}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, a glass bottle is \\(\\boxed{60}\\) grams heavier than a plastic bottle.","ground_truth":"150","predicted_answer":"60","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

We start by setting up the relationship between the number of packages of cups and plates.\n\nLet \\( c \\) be the number of packages of cups and \\( p \\) be the number of packages of plates. Since each package of cups contains 5 cups and each package of plates contains 10 plates, the total number of cups is \\( 5c \\) and the total number of plates is \\( 10p \\). We want the number of cups to equal the number of plates, so we set up the equation:\n\\[ 5c = 10p \\]\n\nWe can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 5:\n\\[ c = 2p \\]\n\nThis equation tells us that \\( c \\) must be an even number.
