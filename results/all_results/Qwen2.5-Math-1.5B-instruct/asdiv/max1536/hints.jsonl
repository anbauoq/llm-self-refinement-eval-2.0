She buys 9 more apples and then gives 7 apples to her friend. How many apples does Sarah have now?\nYour reasoning: Sarah buys 9 apples and then gives 7 of them to her friend, hence she is left with 9 - 7 = 2 apples.\nYour answer: 2\nCorrect answer: 17\n <int>Do not forget to add the apples Sarah already had before accounting for the apples she buys and gives away</int>\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A store sells pencils in boxes of 8. If a teacher needs 50 pencils for her class, how many full boxes should she buy?\nYour reasoning: If 50 pencils are needed, then 50 divided by 8 equals 6.25 boxes. Since the store only sells full boxes, we round to the nearest whole number of boxes. Because 6.25 is closer to 6 than to 7, the teacher should buy 6 full boxes.\nYour answer: 6\nCorrect answer: 7\n <int>After dividing the total number of items by the box size, if there is any remainder, you need to round up to the next whole box so that the total number of items is enough</int>\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A bakery packs 6 cookies in each box. In the morning it sells 14 boxes, and in the afternoon it sells 9 boxes. How many cookies does the bakery sell in total that day?\nYour reasoning: The bakery sells 14 boxes in the morning and 9 boxes in the afternoon, so that’s 14 + 9 = 23 boxes total. Since each box has 6 cookies, a quick estimate is to multiply 6 by 20 to get 120 cookies, and then adjust a little for the extra 3 boxes by adding 3 more cookies, giving 123 cookies total.\n Your answer: 123\nCorrect answer: 138\n <int>It’s important to keep in mind that each box has 6 cookies, so always multiply the number of boxes by 6 to get the total amount of cookies</int>\n\nExample 4:\nQuestion: Mrs. Hilt bought 6 hot dogs.

To find out how many cups each person will have, we divide the total number of cups by the total number of people:\n\\[ \\frac{10 \\text{ cups}}{6 \\text{ people}} = \\frac{5}{3} \\text{ cups per person} \\]\n\nSo, each person will have \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\) cups of lemon tea. In decimal form, this is approximately 1.67 cups, but the exact answer in fraction form is:\n\\[ \\boxed{\\frac{5}{3}} \\]\n\nThe predicted incorrect answer was 5, but the correct answer is \\(\\frac{5}{3}\\). The correct answer is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{5}{3}}\\)."}

If each bag has a capacity of 65 pounds, how many pounds of sand are there in the bag that is not full?","chain_of_thought":"To determine how many pounds of sand are in the bag that is not full, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total number of bags required to hold 757 pounds of sand, given that each bag has a capacity of 65 pounds.\n2. Determine how many pounds of sand are left after filling the bags to their full capacity.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of bags needed. We do this by dividing the total pounds of sand by the capacity of each bag and then rounding up to the next whole number because even if there is a remainder, it still requires an additional bag.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of bags} = \\left\\lceil \\frac{757}{65} \\right\\rceil\n\\]\n\nPerform the division:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{757}{65} \\approx 11.6462\n\\]\n\nRounding 11.6462 up to the next whole number gives us 12 bags.

If she wants each container to have the greatest number of cookies possible, how many plastic containers does she need?","chain_of_thought":"To solve the problem of determining the number of plastic containers needed, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of oatmeal cookies and chocolate chip cookies. The GCD will give us the maximum number of cookies that can be placed in each container while ensuring that each container has the same number of each kind of cookie.\n\nThe number of oatmeal cookies is 30, and the number of chocolate chip cookies is 48. We need to find the GCD of 30 and 48.\n\nFirst, we list the factors of each number:\n- The factors of 30 are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.\n- The factors of 48 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48.\n\nThe common factors of 30 and 48 are: 1, 2, 3, 6.
