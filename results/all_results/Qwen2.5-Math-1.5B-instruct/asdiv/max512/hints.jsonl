She buys 9 more apples and then gives 7 apples to her friend. How many apples does Sarah have now?\nYour reasoning: Sarah buys 9 apples and then gives 7 of them to her friend, hence she is left with 9 - 7 = 2 apples.\nYour answer: 2\nCorrect answer: 17\n <int >Do not forget to add the apples Sarah already had before accounting for the apples she buys and gives away.</int >\n\nExample 2:\nQuestion: A store sells pencils in boxes of 8. If a teacher needs 50 pencils for her class, how many full boxes should she buy?\nYour reasoning: If 50 pencils are needed, then 50 divided by 8 equals 6.25 boxes. Since the store only sells full boxes, we round to the nearest whole number of boxes. Because 6.25 is closer to 6 than to 7, the teacher should buy 6 full boxes.\nYour answer: 6\nCorrect answer: 7\n <int >After dividing the total number of items by the box size, if there is any remainder, you need to round up to the next whole box so that the total number of items is enough.</int >\n\nExample 3:\nQuestion: A bakery packs 6 cookies in each box.
