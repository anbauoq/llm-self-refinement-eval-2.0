Therefore, Jenna's stickers must also be 3 times the number of stickers in the ratio for Jenna. Since the ratio for Jenna is 4, we multiply 4 by 3:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 3 = 12\n\\]\n\nSo, Jenna has \\boxed{12} stickers.","ground_truth":"12","predicted_answer":"12","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Since each package of muffins contains 18 muffins and each package of cookies contains 5 cookies, we can express the total number of muffins and cookies sold as follows:\n\n\\[ 18m = 5c \\]\n\nWe need to find the smallest positive integers \\( m \\) and \\( c \\) that satisfy this equation. This means that \\( 18m \\) must be a multiple of 5, and \\( 5c \\) must be a multiple of 18. The smallest such number is the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 5. Since 18 and 5 are coprime (they have no common factors other than 1), their LCM is simply their product:\n\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(18, 5) = 18 \\times 5 = 90 \\]\n\nSo, the smallest number of muffins (or cookies) sold is 90. To find the corresponding values of \\( m \\) and \\( c \\), we solve the equation:\n\n\\[ 18m = 90 \\implies m = \\frac{90}{18} = 5 \\]\n\\[ 5c = 90 \\implies c = \\frac{90}{5} = 18 \\]\n\nThus, the smallest number of muffins sold is:\n\n\\[ \\boxed{90} \\]","ground_truth":"90","predicted_answer":"90","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}
