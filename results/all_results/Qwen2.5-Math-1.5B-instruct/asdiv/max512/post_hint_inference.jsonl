The final numeric answer should be written in the box with no additional spaces or lines.\nThe question is: atomic fireballs come in packages of 9. Barbara ate 59 atomic fireballs. How many atomic fireballs does she have left?\nThe steps to solve the problem are as follows:\n1. Identify the total number of atomic fireballs Barbara initially had. Since atomic fireballs come in packages of 9, we need to find the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than or equal to 59. The smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than or equal to 59 is 63 (since \\(9 \\times 7 = 63\\)).\n2. Subtract the number of atomic fireballs she ate from the total number she initially had: \\(63 - 59 = 4\\).\nTherefore, the number of atomic fireballs Barbara has left is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).","full_output":"You are a helpful assistant who is supposed to solve math word problems step by step, showing your thought process and writing the final numeric answer in the box.
