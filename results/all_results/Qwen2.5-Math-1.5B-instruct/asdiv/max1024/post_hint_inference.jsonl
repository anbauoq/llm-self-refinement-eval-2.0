The problem states that the post office sold 578,833 color stamps and 523,776 black-and-white stamps. We need to find the sum of these two numbers.\n\nLet's add the numbers step by step:\n\n1. Align the numbers by their place values:\n   ```\n   578,833\n + 523,776\n   ```\n\n2. Add the numbers column by column starting from the rightmost digit:\n   - The units column: \\(3 + 6 = 9\\)\n   - The tens column: \\(3 + 7 = 10\\), so we write down 0 and carry over 1\n   - The hundreds column: \\(8 + 7 = 15\\), plus the carried over 1 makes 16, so we write down 6 and carry over 1\n   - The thousands column: \\(8 + 7 = 15\\), plus the carried over 1 makes 16, so we write down 6 and carry over 1\n   - The ten-thousands column: \\(7 + 3 = 10\\), plus the carried over 1 makes 11, so we write down 1 and carry over 1\n   - The hundred-thousands column: \\(5 + 5 = 10\\), plus the carried over 1 makes 11, so we write down 1 and carry over 1\n   - The millions column: \\(5 + 1 = 6\\), plus the carried over 1 makes 7\n\nPutting it all together, we get:\n```\n  578,833\n+ 523,776\n  1,102,609\n```\n\nSo, the total number of stamps sold is 1,102,609. Since the question asks for the approximate number of stamps sold, we can round this to the nearest thousand, which is 1,103,000. However, the exact number is 1,102,609, so the most accurate answer is:\n\n\\boxed{1103000}","full_output":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of stamps sold by the postal service.

{"id":1087,"question":"At Kentucky Fried Chicken, the kitchen staff baked 96 chicken legs, 144 thighs, and 224 wings. The staff had to prepare platters for a catered lunch at an office. Each platter will have the same number of legs, thighs, and wings. How many platters can the staff make if they want the greatest number of chicken pieces on each platter?","chain_of_thought":"To determine the greatest number of platters that can be made with the same number of chicken pieces on each platter, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers 96, 144, and 224. The GCD is the largest number that divides all three numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\nFirst, we find the prime factorization of each number:\n- The prime factorization of 96 is \\(96 = 2^5 \\times 3\\).\n- The prime factorization of 144 is \\(144 = 2^4 \\times 3^2\\).\n- The prime factorization of 224 is \\(224 = 2^5 \\times 7\\).\n\nThe GCD is found by taking the lowest power of each prime factor that appears in all three factorizations. The only prime factor common to all three numbers is 2, and the lowest power of 2 that appears in all three factorizations is \\(2^4 = 16\\).\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 96, 144, and 224 is 16. This means that the greatest number of chicken pieces that can be on each platter is 16.\n\nTo find the number of platters, we divide the total number of each type of chicken piece by 16:\n- The number of platters based on the legs is \\(96 \\div 16 = 6\\).\n- The number of platters based on the theorems is \\(144 \\div 16 = 9\\).\n- The number of platters based on the wings is \\(224 \\div 16 = 14\\).\n\nSince the number of platters must be the same for all types of chicken pieces, we take the smallest of these values, which is 6. Therefore, the staff can make 6 platters.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).","full_output":"To determine the greatest number of platters that can be made with the same number of chicken pieces on each platter, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numbers 96, 144, and 224.

She wanted to place the pennies into nine stacks, with the same amount in each stack. How many more pennies would she need so all the stacks would be equal?\n\nHint: To determine how many more pennies Megan needs, we start by calculating the total number of pennies she currently has, which is 516. Megan wants to place these pennies into 9 stacks with the same number of pennies in each stack. To find out how many pennies would be in each stack if the pennies were evenly distributed, we divide 516 by 9:\n\n\\[ 516 \\div 9 = 57 \\text{ remainder } 3 \\]\n\nThis means that each stack would have 57 pennies, and there would be 3 pennies left over. To find out how many more pennies Megan needs, we need to determine how many pennies are required to fill all 9 stacks with 57 pennies each. This is calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ 57 \\times 9 = 513 \\]\n\nSince Megan currently has 516 pennies, we subtract the number of pennies she has from the total number of pennies needed:\n\n\\[ 513 - 516 = -3 \\]\n\nSince the result is negative, it means Megan already has more pennies than needed. Instead, she has 3 pennies more than required. Thus, the number of additional pennies Megan needs is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]","full_output":"You are a helpful assistant.
