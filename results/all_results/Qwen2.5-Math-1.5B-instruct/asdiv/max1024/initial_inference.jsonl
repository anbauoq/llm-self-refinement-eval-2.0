Calculate the total number of bureaus required if each of the 14 offices gets an equal number of bureaus.\n2. Compare this total with the number of bureaus the company already has.\n3. Determine the difference, which will be the number of additional bureaus needed.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of bureaus required if each of the 14 offices gets an equal number of bureaus. Since the company buys 88 bureaus in total, we divide 88 by 14 to find out how many bureaus each office would get:\n\n\\[ \\frac{88}{14} \\approx 6.2857 \\]\n\nSince the number of bureaus must be a whole number, each office would need 7 bureaus to ensure that the total number of bureaus is at least enough for all 14 offices. Therefore, the total number of bureaus needed is:\n\n\\[ 14 \\times 7 = 98 \\]\n\nNow, we compare this total with the number of bureaus the company already has, which is 88. The difference is:\n\n\\[ 98 - 88 = 10 \\]\n\nSo, the company needs at least 10 more bureaus.
