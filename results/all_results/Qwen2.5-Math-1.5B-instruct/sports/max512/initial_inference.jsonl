In basketball, a screen pass is a common play where a player runs around the perimeter of the court and then jumps over the screen to score from the free throw line.\n\n2. **Analyze the player**: Alex Piersdorff is a well-known basketball player, specifically a center for the New York times'篮ers team in the 2010-2011 season. He was a top player in the club and made significant contributions in both the regular season and the season divisional round.\n\n3. **Consider the scenario**: In the season divisional round, players are typically in their prime of form and have a high level of performance. It is not unusual for a top player to score from the free throw line in such a round, especially if they are not making any other mistakes or playing with a high level of focus.\n\n4. **Evaluate the likelihood**: Given that Alex Piersdorff is a high-level basketball player and he was in the club for several years, it is reasonable to assume that he would have had the opportunity and the inclination to score from the free throw line in the season divisional round. The fact that he did score from the free throw line in the previous season's divisional round further supports this reasoning.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can conclude that the sentence \"Alex Piersdorff hit the screen pass in the season divisional round\" is reasonably true in a real-world basketball setting.\n\nTherefore, the output should be:\n\n\\boxed{1}","ground_truth":"0","predicted_answer":"1","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

This is a relatively rare event in major league baseball because players are usually either still at first base or still at third base when they are called to second base.\n\n3. **Consider the context of the game**: In a game, players are expected to follow the rules and the field. If a player is called to second base, it is usually because they have been running from first base, and it is not common for them to be out at second base after that.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the likelihood and the context of the game, it is not reasonable or plausible for a player to be out at second base. Therefore, the sentence \"Gardner Minshew was out at second\" is not plausible.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{0}.","ground_truth":"0","predicted_answer":"0","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

In basketball, a \"heat check\" typically means that a player is given a yellow card for a minor error, but it can also lead to a yellow card for a major error or a red card if it's a significant mistake. The number \"three\" indicates that this situation occurred multiple times during the game.\n\n2. **Real- World Sports Setting**: In basketball, players can receive multiple yellow cards for different errors during a game. For example, a player might receive a yellow card for a missed shot, a ball being stolen, or an incorrect pass. The frequency of such occurrences can vary, but it is not common for a player to receive yellow cards three times in a row or even in a game as long as it is not a major error leading to a red card.\n\n3. **Plausibility Analysis**: Given that basketball is a sports where players can receive multiple yellow cards, and considering the typical frequency of such occurrences, it is reasonable to conclude that a player like Nikola Jokic could receive a yellow card three times in a game.

Additionally, the player needs to have the ball in their right hand to make the shot. These are all complex tasks that require physical condition, strategy, and skill.\n\n3. **Consider real-world examples**: While it is possible for a player to make a three-point shot, it is not a common occurrence in a real basketball game. The probability of a player making a three-point shot is relatively low, and it would be unusual for a player to make one in a game where the ball is in their right hand and they are in a good position to shoot.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the complexity of making a three-point shot and the low probability of it occurring in a real basketball game, it is reasonable to conclude that the sentence \"Connor Helle hit a triple\" is not plausible.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\boxed{0}","ground_truth":"0","predicted_answer":"0","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}
