This indicates that the sentence \"Mapou Yenbiw hit the slant pass\" is plausible.","full_output":"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the number of training examples and the number of parameters in the model, and how this affects the model's generalization.\n\n1. **Calculate the current number of parameters in the model:**\n\n   The current number of training examples is \\(10^4\\). Let's denote the number of parameters in the model by \\(C\\). Since the number of parameters is directly proportional to the number of training examples, we can write:\n   \\[\n   C = k \\times 10^4\n   \\]\n   where \\(k\\) is a constant of proportionality. However, we don't need to find the exact value of \\(k\\) to answer the next questions. We just need to know that the current number of parameters is proportional to \\(10^4\\).\n\n2. **Determine the new number of parameters needed after increasing the number of training examples to \\(10^5\\):**\n\n   If we increase the number of training examples to \\(10^5\\), the new number of parameters \\(C_{\\text{new}}\\) will be:\n   \\[\n   C_{\\text{new}} = k \\times 10^5\n   \\]\n\nTo determine if the sentence \"Mapou Yenbiw hit the slant pass\" is plausible, we need to consider the context and the typical performance of a basketball player. Let's analyze the sentence step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the context**: The sentence is about a basketball player hitting a pass. In basketball, a \"slant pass\" is a type of play where the player takes the ball from a distance and throws it at an angle, usually towards the opponent's end of the court.\n\n2. **Consider the player's performance**: We need to know if the player has a good shooting skill and if they can perform a slant pass effectively. In the context of the problem, we are not given any specific information about the player's performance, but we can make a reasonable assumption based on typical basketball players.\n\n3. **Evaluate the sentence**: A basketball player like Mapou Yenbiw (the player being referred to in the sentence) is a professional and has a good shooting skill. It is not common for a professional basketball player to miss a slant pass. Therefore, the sentence \"Mapou Yenbiw hit the slant pass\" is reasonable and plausible.\n\nBased on the analysis, the sentence \"Mapou Yen\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{1}.
