Determine the percentage increase from the wholesale cost to the final price.\n\nLet's go through each step in detail:\n\n1. **Calculate the discounted price:**\n   The original retail price is $200. A 10% discount on $200 is calculated as:\n   \\[\n   10\\% \\text{ of } 200 = 0.10 \\times 200 = 20\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the discounted price is:\n   \\[\n   200 - 20 = 180\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the final price after tax:**\n   A 5% sales tax is applied to the discounted price of $180.

The increase in price is:\n   \\[\n   189 - 200 = -11\n   \\]\n   Since the final price is actually less than the wholesale cost, the correct interpretation is that the final price is $189, which is $19 less than the wholesale cost.

The correct interpretation for the percentage decrease is:\n   \\[\n   \\left( \\frac{189 - 200}{200} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{-11}{200} \\right) \\times 100 = -5.5\\%\n   \\]\n   But since the question asks for the percentage more, we need to consider the positive equivalent, which is a decrease of 5.5%.

Specifically, each face of the outer cube has \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) inner cubes that are not painted, so each face of the outer cube has \\(25 - 9 = 16\\) painted faces.\n   - Since there are 6 faces on the outer cube, the total number of painted faces is \\(6 \\times 16 = 96\\).\n\n5. **Calculate the number of unpainted faces:**\n   - The total number of faces of all the smaller cubes is \\(98 \\times 6 = 588\\).\n   - The number of painted faces is 96, so the number of unpainted faces is \\(588 - 96 = 492\\).\n\nHowever, we need to re-evaluate the problem because the question asks for the number of faces of the smaller cubes that remain unpainted, not the total number of unpainted faces.

However, the problem implies that the answer should be a whole number of hours, and the closest whole number to 2.22 is 2. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{B}","ground_truth":"C","predicted_answer":"B","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

The cost of two sodas and three energy bars is 300 cents:\n   \\[\n   2S + 3B = 300\n   \\]\n\nWe can solve these equations step by step. First, we can eliminate one of the variables by manipulating these equations. Let's eliminate \\( S \\) by making the coefficients of \\( S \\) the same in both equations. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2:\n\\[\n2S + 4B = 300\n\\]\n\nNow we have the system:\n\\[\n2S + 4B = 300\n\\]\n\\[\n2S + 3B = 300\n\\]\n\nNext, we subtract the second equation from the first:\n\\[\n(2S + 4B) - (2S + 3B) = 300 - 300\n\\]\n\\[\n2S + 4B - 2S - 3B = 0\n\\]\n\\[\nB = 0\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\nB = 0\n\\]\n\nNow that we have \\( B = 0 \\), we substitute this value back into the first original equation to find \\( S \\):\n\\[\nS + 2(0) = 150\n\\]\n\\[\nS = 150\n\\]\n\nSo, the cost of a soda is 150 cents and the cost of an energy bar is 0 cents. Now, we need to find the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars:\n\\[\n6S + 7B = 6(150) + 7(0) = 900 + 0 = 900\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of six sodas and seven energy bars is \\(\\boxed{900}\\).","ground_truth":"E","predicted_answer":"E","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Let the density of aluminum be \\(\\rho_{\\text{al}}\\) and the density of silver be \\(\\rho_{\\text{sm}}\\). The weight of the original coin is the sum of the weight of the aluminum and the weight of the silver:\n\\[ W_{\\text{original}} = V_{\\text{al}} \\rho_{\\text{al}} + V_{\\text{sm}} \\rho_{\\text{sm}} = 56.25\\pi \\rho_{\\text{al}} + 56.25\\pi \\rho_{\\text{sm}} = 56.25\\pi (\\rho_{\\text{al}} + \\rho_{\\text{sm}}) \\]\nWe know that the weight of the original coin is 30 grams, so:\n\\[ 56.25\\pi (\\rho_{\\text{al}} + \\rho_{\\text{sm}}) = 30 \\]\n\\[ \\rho_{\\text{al}} + \\rho_{\\text{sm}} = \\frac{30}{56.25\\pi} = \\frac{30}{56.25 \\times 3.14159} \\approx \\frac{30}{176.714} \\approx 0.17 \\text{ g/cm}^3 \\]\n\nNow, let's find the weight of the pure aluminum coin with dimensions 1 mm thick and 30 mm in diameter. The volume of this coin is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{new}} = \\pi \\left(\\frac{30}{2}\\right)^2 \\times 1 = \\pi \\times 15^2 \\times 1 = 225\\pi \\text{ mm}^3 \\]\nThe weight of this pure aluminum coin is:\n\\[ W_{\\text{new}} = V_{\\text{new}} \\rho_{\\text{al}} = 225\\pi \\rho_{\\text{al}} \\]\nSince the volume of the original coin is 112.5\\pi mm³ and the volume of the new coin is 225\\pi mm³, the ratio of their volumes is:\n\\[ \\frac{V_{\\text{new}}}{V_{\\text{original}}} = \\frac{225\\pi}{112.5\\pi} = 2 \\]\nSo the weight of the new coin is twice the weight of the original coin if the density of aluminum is the same. However, we need to consider the fact that the silver is twice as heavy as aluminum. Let the density of aluminum be \\(\\rho_{\\text{al}}\\) and the density of silver be \\(2\\rho_{\\text{al}}\\). The weight of the original coin can be written as:\n\\[ W_{\\text{original}} = 56.25\\pi (\\rho_{\\text{al}} + 2\\rho_{\\text{al}}) = 56.25\\pi \\times 3\\rho_{\\text{al}} = 30 \\]\n\\[ \\rho_{\\text{al}} = \\frac{30}{56.25\\pi \\times 3} = \\frac{30}{176.714} \\approx 0.17 \\text{ g/cm}^3 \\]\nThe weight of the new coin is:\n\\[ W_{\\text{new}} = 225\\pi \\rho_{\\text{al}} = 225\\pi \\times \\frac{30}{176.714 \\times 3} = 225 \\times \\frac{30}{176.714} \\approx 40 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\nTherefore, the weight of the new coin is \\(\\boxed{40}\\) grams.","ground_truth":"B","predicted_answer":"B","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

This means that the difference between 2272 and 875 is divisible by \\( N \\).\n\nFirst, calculate the difference between 2272 and 875:\n\\[ 2272 - 875 = 1397 \\]\n\nSo, \\( N \\) must be a divisor of 1397. We need to find the divisors of 1397. To do this, we perform prime factorization of 1397.\n\nCheck if 1397 is divisible by small prime numbers:\n- 1397 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.\n- The sum of the digits of 1397 is \\( 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20 \\), which is not divisible by 3, so 1397 is not divisible by 3.\n- The last digit is not 0 or 5, so 1397 is not divisible by 5.\n- For 7, we perform the division: \\( 1397 \\div 7 \\approx 199.57 \\), which is not an integer.\n- For 11, we use the alternating sum test: \\( 1 - 3 + 9 - 7 = 0 \\), which is divisible by 11. So, 1397 is divisible by 11.\n- Perform the division: \\( 1397 \\div 11 = 127 \\).\n\nNow, we check if 127 is a prime number. The square root of 127 is approximately 11.3, so we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 11 (i.e., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11):\n- 127 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.\n- The sum of the digits of 127 is \\( 1 + 2 + 7 = 10 \\), which is not divisible by 3, so 127 is not divisible by 3.\n- The last digit is not 0 or 5, so 127 is not divisible by 5.\n- For 7, we perform the division: \\( 127 \\div 7 \\approx 18.14 \\), which is not an integer.\n- For 11, we use the alternating sum test: \\( 1 - 2 + 7 = 6 \\), which is not divisible by 11. So, 127 is not divisible by 11.\n\nSince 127 is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to 11, it is a prime number. Therefore, the prime factorization of 1397 is \\( 11 \\times 127 \\).\n\nThe only 3-digit divisor of 1397 is 127. The sum of the digits of 127 is:\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 7 = 10 \\]\n\nSo, the correct answer is:\n\\[ \\boxed{A} \\]","full_output":"To solve the problem, we need to find a 3-digit number \\( N \\) such that when 2272 and 875 are divided by \\( N \\), they leave the same remainder.

We need to find the divisors of 1397. To do this, we perform prime factorization of 1397.\n\nCheck if 1397 is divisible by small prime numbers:\n- 1397 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.\n- The sum of the digits of 1397 is \\( 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20 \\), which is not divisible by 3, so 1397 is not divisible by 3.\n- The last digit is not 0 or 5, so 1397 is not divisible by 5.\n- For 7, we perform the division: \\( 1397 \\div 7 \\approx 199.57 \\), which is not an integer.\n- For 11, we use the alternating sum test: \\( 1 - 3 + 9 - 7 = 0 \\), which is divisible by 11. So, 1397 is divisible by 11.\n- Perform the division: \\( 1397 \\div 11 = 127 \\).\n\nNow, we check if 127 is a prime number. The square root of 127 is approximately 11.3, so we only need to check divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 11 (i.e., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11):\n- 127 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.\n- The sum of the digits of 127 is \\( 1 + 2 + 7 = 10 \\), which is not divisible by 3, so 127 is not divisible by 3.\n- The last digit is not 0 or 5, so 127 is not divisible by 5.\n- For 7, we perform the division: \\( 127 \\div 7 \\approx 18.14 \\), which is not an integer.\n- For 11, we use the alternating sum test: \\( 1 - 2 + 7 = 6 \\), which is not divisible by 11. So, 127 is not divisible by 11.\n\nSince 127 is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to 11, it is a prime number. Therefore, the prime factorization of 1397 is \\( 11 \\times 127 \\).\n\nThe only 3-digit divisor of 1397 is 127.
