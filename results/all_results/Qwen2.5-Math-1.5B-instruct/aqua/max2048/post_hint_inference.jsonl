The perimeter \\( P \\) of a rectangle is given by:\n   \\[\n   P = 2 \\times (\\text{length} + \\text{width}) = 2 \\times (27 + 17) = 2 \\times 44 = 88 \\text{ cm}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the side length of the square:**\n   When the wire is rebent into a square, the perimeter remains the same.

The height of the room is:\n\nOptions:\nA)2.6m\nB)3.9m\nC)4m\nD)4.2m\nE)4.4m","chain_of_thought":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the height of the room given the relationship between the height and the semi-perimeter, and the cost of papering the walls. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the relationship between height and semi-perimeter\nThe problem states that the height of the room is in the ratio 2:5 with its semi-perimeter. Let's denote the height of the room by \\( h \\) and the semi-perimeter by \\( s \\). According to the given ratio, we have:\n\\[ h = \\frac{2}{5} s \\]\n\n### Step 2: Determine the area of the walls to be papered\nThe area of the walls to be papered is the perimeter of the room times the height minus the area of doors and windows. The perimeter of the room is \\( 2(l + b) \\), where \\( l \\) is the length and \\( b \\) is the width. Since the room is rectangular, we can express the perimeter as:\n\\[ \\text{Perimeter} = 2(l + b) \\]\n\nThe area of the walls to be papered is:\n\\[ \\text{Area of walls} = \\text{Perimeter} \\times h - \\text{Area of doors and windows} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Area of walls} = 2(l + b) \\times h - 15 \\]\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the cost of papering\nThe cost of papering the walls is given as Rs.260, and the paper is 50 cm wide at Rs.2 per meter. Therefore, the cost per meter of paper is Rs.2, and since the paper is 50 cm (0.5 meters) wide, the cost per meter of paper is:\n\\[ \\text{Cost per meter} = 2 \\text{ Rs/m} \\]\n\nThe total length of paper used is the area of the walls divided by the width of the paper:\n\\[ \\text{Length of paper} = \\frac{2(l + b) \\times h - 15}{0.5} \\]\n\nThe total cost is:\n\\[ \\text{Total cost} = \\text{Length of paper} \\times \\text{Cost per meter} \\]\n\\[ 260 = \\left( \\frac{2(l + b) \\times h - 15}{0.5} \\right) \\times 2 \\]\n\\[ 260 = \\frac{2 \\times 2(l + b) \\times h - 30}{0.5} \\]\n\\[ 260 = 4(l + b) \\times h - 60 \\]\n\\[ 320 = 4(l + b) \\times h \\]\n\\[ 80 = (l + b) \\times h \\]\n\n### Step 4: Substitute the height in terms of the semi-perimeter\nFrom the ratio \\( h = \\frac{2}{5} s \\), we substitute \\( h \\) in the equation:\n\\[ 80 = (l + b) \\times \\frac{2}{5} s \\]\n\\[ 400 = (l + b) \\times s \\]\n\n### Step 5: Determine the height\nWe need to find a height that satisfies the equation and is one of the given options.

The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?\n\n Options:\nA)50\nB)70\nC)75\nD)100\nE)125\n\n hint: To determine the number of files that were not infected by a worm, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let \\( V \\) be the number of files infected by a virus.\n   - Let \\( W \\) be the number of files infected by a worm.\n   - Let \\( B \\) be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.\n\n2. **Use Given Information:**\n   - The total number of files is 250.\n   - The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.\n   - 50% of the files were not infected by a virus.\n\n3. **Set Up Equations:**\n   - From the total number of files:\n     \\[\n     V + W - B = 250\n     \\]\n   - From the number of files infected only by a worm:\n     \\[\n     W - B = 2.5B\n     \\]\n   - From the number of files not infected by a virus:\n     \\[\n     0.5 \\times 250 = 125\n     \\]\n\n4. **Solve for \\( B \\):**\n   \\[\n   W - B = 2.5B\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   W = 3.5B\n   \\]\n\n5. **Substitute \\( W \\) in the total number of files equation:**\n   \\[\n   V + 3.5B - B = 250\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   V + 2.5B = 250\n   \\]\n\n6. **Determine \\( V \\):**\n   Since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus:\n   \\[\n   V = 125\n   \\]\n\n7. **Find \\( B \\):**\n   \\[\n   125 + 2.5B = 250\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   2.5B = 125\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   B = 50\n   \\]\n\n8. **Calculate the number of files infected only by a worm:**\n   \\[\n   W - B = 3.5B - 50\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   W - B = 175 - 50\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   W = 125\n   \\]\n\n9. **Calculate the number of files not infected by a worm:**\n   \\[\n   250 - V = 250 - 125\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   = 125\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of files that were not infected by a worm is \\(\\boxed{125}\\).","predicted_answer":null,"ground_truth":"C","is_correct":null,"was_retried":true}
