Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Initial Setup:**\n   - We know that initially, the bag contains only white marbles.\n   - After painting 20 marbles black, the bag now contains 20 black marbles and some number of white marbles, let's call this number \\( W \\).\n\n2. **Second Draw:**\n   - The second draw consists of 20 marbles, of which 1 is black.\n   - This means that the proportion of black marbles in the second draw is \\( \\frac{1}{20} \\).\n\n3. **Percentage Representation:**\n   - The problem states that the percentage of black marbles pulled out the second time represents their percentage in the bag.\n   - Therefore, the proportion of black marbles in the second draw should be equal to the proportion of black marbles in the bag.\n\n4. **Setting Up the Equation:**\n   - Let \\( T \\) be the total number of marbles in the bag after the second draw.\n   - The proportion of black marbles in the bag after the second draw is \\( \\frac{21}{T} \\) (since there are now 21 black marbles in the bag).\n\n5. **Equating the Proportions:**\n   - From the information given, we have:\n     \\[\n     \\frac{1}{20} = \\frac{21}{T}\n     \\]\n\n6. **Solving for \\( T \\):**\n   - Cross-multiplying to solve for \\( T \\):\n     \\[\n     1 \\cdot T = 20 \\cdot 21\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     T = 420\n     \\]\n\n7. **Determining the Initial Number of White Marbles:**\n   - Initially, there were 20 black marbles and \\( W \\) white marbles.\n   - After the second draw, the total number of marbles is \\( 21 \\) black marbles plus \\( W \\) white marbles, which we found to be \\( 420 \\):\n     \\[\n     21 + W = 420\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     W = 420 - 21\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     W = 399\n     \\]\n\n8. **Total Number of Marbles Initially:**\n   - Initially, there were 20 black marbles and 399 white marbles:\n     \\[\n     20 + 399 = 419\n     \\]\n\n9. **Final Total Number of Marbles:**\n   - After the second draw, the total number of marbles in the bag is:\n     \\[\n     420\n     \\]\n\nTherefore, the final total number of marbles in the bag is \\(\\boxed{420}\\).\n\nQuestion: A phone has a marked price of $200.

What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400.\n\nOptions:\nA)226\nB)230\n<MSK>)240\nD)260\nE)280\n\nYour reasoning: They make 420 units per month for 12 months, so in a year they sell 420 * 12 = 5040 components. Production cost per unit is 110, so total yearly cost is 5040 * 110 = 554400. Let p be the selling price per component. Yearly revenue is 5040p, so profit is 5040p - 554400. We need 5040p - 554400 >= 626400, so 5040p >= 1180800 and p >= 1180800 / 5040 = 234.3. The closest answer <MSK>hoice to that number is 230, so the correct answer is B.\n\nYour answer: B\nCorrect answer: <MSK>\n <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int制> <int"}

What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400. Options: A)226 B)230 C)240 <MSK>)260 E)280 Your reasoning: They make 420 units per month for 12 months, so in a year they sell 420 * 12 = 5040 components. Production cost per unit is 110, so total yearly cost is 5040 * 110 = 554400. Let p be the selling price per component. Yearly revenue is 5040p, so profit is 5040p - 554400.

Correct answer: C. <int > The selling price can not be smaller than the exact value that makes yearly profit equal to $626,400, because anything smaller would not guarantee meeting that target.</int > Example 2: Question: In how many ways can the letters of the word \"PROBLEM\" be rearranged to make 7-letter words such that none of the letters repeat?

To exclude the highest and lowest scores from the results, we need to subtract from the sum of all scores the highest and lowest scores, whose sum is 2x. Hence, the correct answer is (zy - 2x)/z, which matches option A.\n Your answer: A.\nCorrect answer: <MSK>.\n <int > When you remove the highest and lowest scores, you also remove two students from the total count, so the new average must be computed by dividing by z minus 2.</int > Example 4: Question: A phone has a marked price of $200.

A 10% discount is 20, so the discounted price is 200 - 20 = 180. Then a 5% sales tax is 5% of the original 200, which is 10, so add 10 to 180 to get 190.

The total number of files is 250.\n2. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   W - B = 2.5B\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   W = 3.5B\n   \\]\n3. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that 50% of the files were infected by a worm (either only by a worm or by both a virus and a worm). Therefore, the number of files infected by a worm (either only by a worm or by both a virus and a worm) is:\n   \\[\n   W = 0.5 \\times 250 = 125\n   \\]\n4. Now we can substitute \\( W = 125 \\) into the equation \\( W = 3.5B \\):\n   \\[\n   125 = 3.5B\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( B \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{125}{3.5} = \\frac{1250}{35} = \\frac{250}{7} \\approx 35.71 \\approx 35.71\n   \\]\n   Since the number of files must be a whole number, we can verify that \\( B = 35 \\) (as the exact value is very close to 35.71 and the problem likely expects an integer solution).\n\n5. Now we can find the number of files infected only by a worm:\n   \\[\n   W - B = 125 - 35 = 90\n   \\]\n6. The number of files not infected by a virus is the number of files not infected by either a virus or a worm. Since the total number of files is 250, the number of files not infected by a virus is:\n   \\[\n   250 - V\n   \\]\n   We know that \\( V = W + B - B = 125 + 35 - 35 = 125 \\), so:\n   \\[\n   250 - 125 = 125\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of files that were not infected by a worm is \\(\\boxed{125}\\).","full_output":"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of files that are not infected by a worm. Let's define the following variables:\n\n- Let \\( V \\) be the number of files infected by a virus.\n- Let \\( W \\) be the number of files infected by a worm.\n- Let \\( B \\) be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.\n\nFrom the problem, we know the following:\n\n1. The total number of files is 250.\n2. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   W - B = 2.5B\n   \\]\n   Simplifying this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   W = 3.5B\n   \\]\n3. 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that 50% of the files were infected by a worm (either only by a worm or by both a virus and a worm). Therefore, the number of files infected by a worm (either only by a worm or by both a virus and a worm) is:\n   \\[\n   W = 0.5 \\times 250 = 125\n   \\]\n4. Now we can substitute \\( W = 125 \\) into the equation \\( W = 3.5B \\):\n   \\[\n   125 = 3.5B\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( B \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{125}{3.5} = \\frac{1250}{35} = \\frac{250}{7} \\approx 35.71 \\approx 35.71\n   \\]\n   Since the number of files must be a whole number, we can verify that \\( B = 35 \\) (as the exact value is very close to 35.71 and the problem likely expects an integer solution).\n\n5. Now we can find the number of files infected only by a worm:\n   \\[\n   W - B = 125 - 35 = 90\n   \\]\n6. The number of files not infected by a virus is the number of files not infected by either a virus or a worm.
