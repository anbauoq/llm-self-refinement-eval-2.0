The area of the original rectangular sheet is 792 square centimeters.\n\n your reasoning: When the rectangular sheet is folded into two equal halves along one set of sides, each smaller rectangle has a perimeter of 48 cm. This means that the sum of the length and the width of the smaller rectangle is 24 cm (since the perimeter is 48 cm, and the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2(l + w)). When the rectangular sheet is folded into two equal halves along the other set of sides, each smaller rectangle has a perimeter of 66 cm. This means that the sum of the length and the width of the smaller rectangle is 33 cm. Therefore, the length of the original rectangular sheet is 33 cm and the width is 24 cm. The area of the original rectangular sheet is therefore 33 cm * 24 cm = 792 square centimeters.\n\n your answer is correct. The area of the original rectangular sheet is 792 square centimeters.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{C}. This is the area of the original rectangular sheet.

This is simply the number of permutations of 10 distinct items, which is given by \\(10!\\) (10 factorial).\n\nHowever, we have the constraint that the pm must speak before the mp and the mp must speak before the mla.
