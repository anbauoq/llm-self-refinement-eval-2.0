Production cost per unit is 110, so total yearly cost is 5040 * 110 = 554400. Let p be the selling price per component. Yearly revenue is 5040p, so profit is 5040p - 554400. We need 5040p - 554400 >= 626400, so 5040p >= 1180800 and p >= 1180800 / 5040 = 234.3. The closest answer choice to that number is 230, so the correct answer is B.\n\nYour answer: B\nCorrect answer: C\n <int>234.3 is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400. The closest answer choice to that number is 230, so the correct answer is B.\n your reasoning: They make 420 units per month for 12 months, so in <MSK> year they sell 420 * 12 = 5040 components. Production cost per unit is 110, so total yearly cost is 5040 * 110 = 554400. Let p be the selling price per component. Yearly revenue is 5040p, so profit is 5040p - 554400. We need 504"}

Use the binomial probability formula to find the probability of exactly four out of five registered voters voting in the last election. The binomial probability formula is given by:\n   \\[\n   P(X = k) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k}\n   \\]\n   where \\( n \\) is the number of trials (in this case, 5), \\( k \\) is the number of successes (in this case, 4), \\( p \\) is the probability of success on a single trial (in this case, 0.9), and \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\) is the binomial coefficient, which represents the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) successes out of \\( n \\) trials.\n\n3. Substitute the values into the formula:\n   \\[\n   P(X = 4) = \\binom{5}{4} (0.9)^4 (0.1)^{5-4} = 5 \\cdot (0.9)^4 \\cdot (0.1)^1 = 5 \\cdot 0.6561 \\cdot 0.1 = 0.32805\n   \\]\n\n4. Round the result to the nearest percentage: 0.32805 is approximately 32.8%.\n\nTherefore, the approximate likelihood that exactly four of the five randomly chosen registered voters voted in the last election is \\(\\boxed{B}\\).\n\nSo the hint for this problem could be: \"The approximate likelihood that exactly four of the five randomly chosen registered voters voted in the last election is \\(\\boxed{B}\\).\"\n\nThis hint provides the correct answer and helps the model arrive"}
