Let's solve the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the volume of the original coin. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:\n\\[ V = \\pi r^2 h \\]\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius and \\( h \\) is the height (or thickness in this case).\n\nFor the original coin:\n- Diameter = 15 mm, so radius \\( r = \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \\) mm\n- Thickness \\( h = 2 \\) mm\n\nThe volume of the original coin is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{original}} = \\pi (7.5)^2 (2) = \\pi \\times 56.25 \\times 2 = 112.5\\pi \\text{ mm}^3 \\]\n\nSince the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver in the alloy, the volume of each (aluminum and silver) is half of the total volume:\n\\[ V_{\\text{aluminum}} = V_{\\text{silver}} = \\frac{112.5\\pi}{2} = 56.25\\pi \\text{ mm}^3 \\]\n\nThe weight of the original coin is 30 grams, and the total volume of the alloy is the sum of the volumes of aluminum and silver. The weight of the alloy is the sum of the weights of aluminum and silver. Since silver is twice as heavy as aluminum, we can say that if the weight of aluminum is \\( w \\), then the weight of silver is \\( 2w \\). Therefore, the total weight is:\n\\[ w + 2w = 3w = 30 \\text{ grams} \\]\n\\[ w = 10 \\text{ grams} \\]\nSo, the weight of aluminum is 10 grams and the weight of silver is 20 grams.\n\nNow, we need to find the weight of a pure aluminum coin with dimensions 1 x 30 mm. The volume of this new coin is:\n\\[ V_{\\text{new}} = \\pi (15/2)^2 (1) = \\pi \\times 56.25 \\times 1 = 56.25\\pi \\text{\n\nA)36 grams\nB)40 grams\nC)42 grams\nD)48 grams\nE)50 grams\nThe correct answer is \\boxed{A}.","ground_truth":"B","predicted_answer":"A","is_correct":false,"was_retried":true}
