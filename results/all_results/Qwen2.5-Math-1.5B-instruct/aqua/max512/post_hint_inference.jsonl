If Sajal gives $10 to Arun, the amount of money Arun will have is three times the amount of money Sajal will have left.\n\nLet's translate these conditions into equations.\n\n**First condition:**\nAfter Arun gives $30 to Sajal, Arun will have \\( A - 30 \\) dollars and Sajal will have \\( S + 30 \\) dollars. According to the first condition, the amount of money Sajal will have is twice the amount of money Arun will have left:\n\\[ S + 30 = 2(A - 30) \\]\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\\[ S + 30 = 2A - 60 \\]\n\\[ S = 2A - 90 \\quad \\text{(Equation 1)} \\]\n\n**Second condition:**\nAfter Sajal gives $10 to Arun, Arun will have \\( A + 10 \\) dollars and Sajal will have \\( S - 10 \\) dollars.

This means that the number of students must be a common multiple of the denominators of the fractions 20/100 and 28/100, which are 5 and 25, respectively. The least common multiple (LCM) of 5 and 25 is 25. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 25k for some integer k. Since we need more than 501 students, we need to find the smallest k such that 25k > 501. Solving for k, we get k > 501/25 = 20.04. The smallest integer greater than 20.04 is 21. Therefore, the least possible number of students in the school is 25 * 21 = 525.
