{"id":184,"question":"A certain phone manufacturer ships its products in crates. A crate consists of p pallets, and each pallet holds 1250 phones.

Identify the number of pallets in one crate. According to the problem, there are \\( p \\) pallets in one crate.\n2. Determine the number of phones in one pallet. Each pallet holds 1250 phones.\n3. Calculate the total number of phones in one crate. Since one crate consists of \\( p \\) pallets and each table holds 1250 phones, the number of phones in one crate is \\( 1250p \\).\n4. Find out how many crates are being shipped. The problem states that 4 crates are being shipped.\n5. Calculate the total number of phones shipped by multiplying the number of phones in one crate by the number of crates. Therefore, the total number of phones shipped is \\( 4 \\times 1250p = 5000p \\).\n\nHowever, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or the options provided, as the correct answer should be in terms of \\( p \\) and not \\( 1000p \\), \\( 1500p \\), \\( 2000p \\), \\( 2500p \\), or \\( 30000 \\).

Since the fraction of girls is \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\), the fraction of boys is \\( 1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5} \\).\r\n\r\n4. **Set up the equation for the number of boys:** The number of boys is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of the total number of children. Therefore, we can write: \\[\n\\frac{3}{5} T = 100\r\n\\]\r\n\r\n5. **Solve for the total number of children \\( T \\):** To find \\( T \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\): \\[\nT = 100 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{500}{3} \\approx 166.67\r\n\\] However, since the number of children must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's instead find the total number of children using the given fraction.\r\n\r\n6. **Calculate the total number of children using the given fraction:** Let \\( G \\) be the number of girls in the class. The total number of children is \\( G + 100 \\). Since \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of the children are girls: \\[\n\\frac{2}{5} (G + 100) = G\r\n\\]\r\n\r\n7. **Solve for \\( G \\):** Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction: \\[\n2(G + 100) = 5G\r\n\\] Simplify and solve for \\( G \\): \\[\n2G + 200 = 5G\r\n\\] \\[\n200 = 3G\r\n\\] \\[\nG = \\frac{200}{3} = 100\r\n\\]\r\n\r\nTherefore, the number of girls in the class is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).```\r\n\r\nYou are a helpful assistant. your job is to look at the model’s reasoning, the model’s chosen answer, and the correct answer, then write a short hint that would have helped the model arrive at the correct option if that hint had been included in the original question.\r\n\r\n important rules:\r\n - Don't write the correct answer or the correct option letter in the hint sentences.\r\n - Don't mention any option letters (A–E) or say any option is wrong or right.\r\n - The hint must read like neutral background information or neutral guide.\r\n\r\nThe hint should be written in a way that makes the model understand the problem and the solution, and should not be too long or complex.

If there are 100 boys in the class, how many girls are in the class?\n\nOptions:\r\nA)50\r\nB)100\r\nC)150\r\nD)200\r\nE)70\r\n\r\nYour reasoning: To determine the number of girls in the class, we start by understanding the given information and setting up the problem step by step.\r\n\r\n1. **Identify the fraction of girls in the class:** The problem states that exactly \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of the children in the class are girls.\r\n\r\n2. **Determine the number of boys in the class:** We are given that there are 100 boys in the class.\r\n\r\n3. **Express the total number of children in terms of boys and girls:** Let \\( T \\) be the total number of children in the class. Since the fraction of girls is \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\), the fraction of boys is \\( 1 - \\frac{2}{5} = \\frac{3}{5} \\).\r\n\r\n4. **Set up the equation for the number of boys:** The number of boys is \\( \\frac{3}{5} \\) of the total number of children. Therefore, we can write: \\[\n\\frac{3}{5} T = 100\r\n\\]\r\n\r\n5. **Solve for the total number of children \\( T \\):** To find \\( T \\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\): \\[\nT = 100 \\times \\frac{5}{3} = \\frac{500}{3} \\approx 166.67\r\n\\] However, since the number of children must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's instead find the total number of children using the given fraction.\r\n\r\n6. **Calculate the total number of children using the given fraction:** Let \\( G \\) be the number of girls in the class. The total number of children is \\( G + 100 \\). Since \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\) of the children are girls: \\[\n\\frac{2}{5} (G + 100) = G\r\n\\]\r\n\r\n7. **Solve for \\( G \\):** Multiply both sides by 5 to clear the fraction: \\[\n2(G + 100) = 5G\r\n\\] Simplify and solve for \\( G \\): \\[\n2G + 200 = 5G\r\n\\] \\[\n200 = 3G\r\n\\] \\[\nG = \\frac{200}{3} = 100\r\n\\]\r\n\r\nTherefore, the number of girls in the class is \\(\\boxed{100}\\).```\r\n\r\nYou are a helpful assistant. your job is to look at the model’s reasoning, the model’s chosen answer, and the correct answer, then write a short hint that would have helped the model arrive at the correct option if that hint had been included in the original question.\r\n\r\n important rules:\r\n - Don't write the correct answer or the correct option letter in the hint sentences.\r\n - Don't mention any option letters (A–E) or say any option is wrong or right.\r\n - The hint must read like neutral background information or neutral guide.\r\n\r\nThe hint should be written in a way that makes the model understand the problem and the solution, and should not be too long or complex. It should be short enough to be easily understood, but not so short that it does not provide enough information.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a hint for a question about finding the number of girls in a class:\r\nQuestion: Exactly 2/5th of the children in a certain class are girls.
