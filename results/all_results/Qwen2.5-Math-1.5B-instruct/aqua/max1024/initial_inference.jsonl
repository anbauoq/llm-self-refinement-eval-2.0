So, the number of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation is \\( 0.40E \\).\n4. The percentage of employees who take neither a winter nor a summer vacation is 20%. So, the number of employees who take neither a winter nor a summer vacation is \\( 0.20E \\).\n\nWe need to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. Let's denote the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation by \\( S \\). We can use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find \\( S \\).\n\nThe total number of employees can be expressed as the sum of those who take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, those who take a winter vacation but not a summer vacation, those who take both a winter and a summer vacation, and those who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n\n\\[ E = 0.20E + (0.75E - 0.40E) + 0.40E + (S - 0.40E) \\]\n\nSimplifying the right-hand side, we get:\n\n\\[ E = 0.20E + 0.35E + 0.40E + (S - 0.40E) \\]\n\\[ E = 0.20E + 0.35E + 0.40E + S - 0.40E \\]\n\\[ E = 0.55E + S - 0.40E \\]\n\\[ E = 0.15E + S \\]\n\\[ S = E - 0.15E \\]\n\\[ S = 0.85E \\]\n\nSo, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation is 85%. Now, we need to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. This is given by:\n\n\\[ S - \\text{number of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation} \\]\n\\[ 85\\% - 40\\% = 45\\% \\]\n\nTherefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is \\(\\boxed{45}\\).","ground_truth":"A","predicted_answer":"E","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

So, the ratio of the profits of A, B, and C is given by:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio of profits} = \\left(40000 \\times 12\\right) : \\left(60000 \\times 10\\right) : \\left(120000 \\times (12 - x)\\right) \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[ \\text{Ratio of profits} = 480000 : 600000 : 120000(12 - x) \\]\n\\[ \\text{Ratio of profits} = 4 : 5 : 12(12 - x)/10 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Ratio of profits} = 4 : 5 : 1.2(12 - x) \\]\n\nWe know that the total profit is Rs.375,000 and C's share is Rs.150,000.

Since the profit is divided in the ratio 4:5:1.2(12 - x), C's share is \\(\\frac{1.2(12 - x)}{4 + 5 + 1.2(12 - x)}\\) of the total profit. Setting this equal to \\(\\frac{2}{5}\\), we get:\n\\[ \\frac{1.2(12 - x)}{4 + 5 + 1.2(12 - x)} = \\frac{2}{5} \\]\n\\[ \\frac{1.2(12 - x)}{9 + 1.2(12 - x)} = \\frac{2}{5} \\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\\[ 5 \\cdot 1.2(12 - x) = 2 \\cdot (9 + 1.2(12 - x)) \\]\n\\[ 6(12 - x) = 2(9 + 1.2(12 - x)) \\]\n\\[ 72 - 6x = 18 + 2.4(12 - x) \\]\n\\[ 72 - 6x = 18 + 28.8 - 2.4x \\]\n\\[ 72 - 6x = 46.8 - 2.4x \\]\n\\[ 72 - 46.8 = 6x - 2.4x \\]\n\\[ 25.2 = 3.6x \\]\n\\[ x = \\frac{25.2}{3.6} = 7 \\]\n\nTherefore, C joined after 7 months from B joined.

If \\( n \\) is even, the median is the average of the incomes of the \\(\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)\\)-th and \\(\\left(\\frac{n}{2}+1\\right)\\)-th members.\n\nSince the median income is $3000, the middle value(s) of the income distribution must be $3000. Let's consider the possible values of \\( n \\):\n\n1. If \\( n = 2 \\), the median would be the average of the first and second incomes, which is not possible since we need exactly one income to be $3000 and the other to be less than or equal to $3000, but we don't have enough information to satisfy the total income condition.\n2. If \\( n = 3 \\), the median would be the income of the second member, which is $3000. The total income would be the sum of the three incomes. Let's denote the incomes by \\( a \\leq 3000 \\leq b \\leq c \\). The total income is \\( a + 3000 + c = 9000 \\), so \\( a + c = 6000 \\). This is possible, so \\( n = 3 \\) is a valid solution.\n3. If \\( n = 4 \\), the median would be the average of the second and third incomes, which must both be $3000. The total income would be \\( a + 3000 + 3000 + d = 9000 \\), so \\( a + d = 3000 \\). This is possible, so \\( n = 4 \\) is a valid solution.\n4. If \\( n = 5 \\), the median would be the income of the third member, which is $3000. The total income would be the sum of the five incomes. Let's denote the incomes by \\( a \\leq 3000 \\leq b \\leq 3000 \\leq c \\). The total income is \\( a + 3000 + 3000 + 3000 + c = 9000 \\), so \\( a + c = 0 \\). This is not possible since \\( a \\) and \\( c \\) are positive incomes.\n5. If \\( n = 6 \\), the median would be the average of the third and fourth incomes, which must both be $3000. The total income would be \\( a + 3000 + 3000 + b + 3000 + d = 9000 \\), so \\( a + b + d = 0 \\). This is not possible since \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( d \\) are positive incomes.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the only valid solutions are \\( n = 3 \\) and \\( n = 4 \\). However, since the problem asks for the number of family members and we need to choose the correct option, we need to consider the context. The problem does not provide enough information to distinguish between \\( n = 3 \\) and \\( n = 4 \\) based solely on the given conditions. However, typically in such problems, the smallest possible number of family members is preferred unless otherwise specified. Therefore, the most logical and consistent answer is \\( n = 3 \\).\n\nThus, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{B}\\).","ground_truth":"B","predicted_answer":"B","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

This means that the difference between 2272 and 875 is divisible by \\( N \\). Let's calculate this difference:\n\n\\[ 2272 - 875 = 1397 \\]\n\nSo, \\( N \\) must be a divisor of 1397. We need to find the divisors of 1397 and identify the 3-digit divisor. First, let's check if 1397 is a prime number or if it can be factored further.\n\nWe can start by checking divisibility by smaller prime numbers:\n\n- 1397 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.\n- The sum of the digits of 1397 is \\( 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20 \\), which is not divisible by 3, so 1397 is not divisible by 3.\n- 1397 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.\n- For divisibility by 7, we perform the division: \\( 1397 \\div 7 \\approx 199.571 \\), which is not an integer, so 1397 is not divisible by 7.\n- For divisibility by 11, we use the alternating sum of the digits: \\( 1 - 3 + 9 - 7 = 0 \\), which is divisible by 11, so 1397 is divisible by 11.\n\nLet's divide 1397 by 11:\n\n\\[ 1397 \\div 11 = 127 \\]\n\nSo, 1397 = 11 * 127. Now we need to check if 127 is a prime number. We check divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 127 (approximately 11.3):\n\n- 127 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11 (as we have already checked).\n\nSince 127 is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number. Therefore, the only 3-digit divisor of 1397 is 127. Now, we need to find the sum of the digits of 127:\n\n\\[ 1 + 2 + 7 = 10 \\]\n\nSo, the sum of the digits of \\( N \\) is 10. The correct answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]","full_output":"To solve the problem, we need to find a 3-digit number \\( N \\) such that when 2272 and 875 are divided by \\( N \\), they leave the same remainder. This means that the difference between 2272 and 875 is divisible by \\( N \\). Let's calculate this difference:\n\n\\[ 2272 - 875 = 1397 \\]\n\nSo, \\( N \\) must be a divisor of 1397. We need to find the divisors of 1397 and identify the 3-digit divisor. First, let's check if 1397 is a prime number or if it can be factored further.\n\nWe can start by checking divisibility by smaller prime numbers:\n\n- 1397 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.\n- The sum of the digits of 1397 is \\( 1 + 3 + 9 + 7 = 20 \\), which is not divisible by 3, so 1397 is not divisible by 3.\n- 1397 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.\n- For divisibility by 7, we perform the division: \\( 1397 \\div 7 \\approx 199.571 \\), which is not an integer, so 1397 is not divisible by 7.\n- For divisibility by 11, we use the alternating sum of the digits: \\( 1 - 3 + 9 - 7 = 0 \\), which is divisible by 11, so 1397 is divisible by 11.\n\nLet's divide 1397 by 11:\n\n\\[ 1397 \\div 11 = 127 \\]\n\nSo, 1397 = 11 * 127. Now we need to check if 127 is a prime number. We check divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 127 (approximately 11.3):\n\n- 127 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11 (as we have already checked).\n\nSince 127 is not divisible by any of these primes, it is a prime number.
