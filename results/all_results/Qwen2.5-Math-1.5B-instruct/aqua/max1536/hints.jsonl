Therefore, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months is:\n   \\[\n   20 \\times 10 = 200\n   \\]\n\n2. The average number of microwave ovens sold per month for the entire year (12 months) is 42. Therefore, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the entire year is:\n   \\[\n   42 \\times 12 = 504\n   \\]\n\n3. Since we already know the total number of microwave ovens sold in the first 10 months is 200, the total number of microwave ovens sold in the remaining 12 months is:\n   \\[\n   504 - 200 = 304\n   \\]\n\n4. The average number of microwave ovens sold per month during the entire 22 months period is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{504}{22} = 22.909090909090908 \\approx 23\n   \\]\n\nSince the closest option to 23 is not listed, the correct answer is:\n\\boxed{E}","ground_truth":"D","predicted_answer":"E","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false,"hint_sentence":"You are a helpful assistant who needs to write a hint to this question.\n\nQuestion: A certain number of students are in a class.

When 3 students are removed, the average age of the remaining \\( n-3 \\) students is 15 years, so the total age of the remaining students is \\( 15(n-3) \\). This means the total age of the 3 students removed is \\( S - 15(n-3) \\). Similarly, when 5 students are removed, the average age of the remaining \\( n-5 \\) students is 12 years, so the total age of the remaining students is \\( 12(n-5) \\). This means the total age of the 5 students removed is \\( S - 12(n-5) \\).\n\nSince the total age of all students is the same in both scenarios, we can set up the following equation:\n\\[ S - 15(n-3) = S - 12(n-5) \\]\nSimplifying this equation, we get:\n\\[ -15(n-3) = -12(n-5) \\]\n\\[ 15(n-3) = 12(n-5) \\]\n\\[ 15n - 45 = 12n - 60 \\]\n\\[ 3n = -15 \\]\n\\[ n = 25 \\]\n\nNow, we can find the total age \\( S \\) by using the fact that the average age of the remaining students when 3 students are removed is 15 years:\n\\[ S - 15(n-3) = 15(n-3) \\]\n\\[ S - 15 \\times 22 = 15 \\times 22 \\]\n\\[ S - 330 = 330 \\]\n\\[ S = 660 \\]\n\nThe average age of all the students in the class is:\n\\[ \\frac{S}{n} = \\frac{660}{25} = 26.4 \\]\n\nSince the closest option to 26.4 is not listed, the correct answer is:\n\\boxed{E}"}

{"id":61,"question":"Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. If the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. What is definitely the difference between R and Q's age?\n\nOptions:\nA)22\nB)27\nC)29\nD)Cannot be determined\nE)None of the above","chain_of_thought":"To solve the problem, let's define the ages of Q, R, and T using variables. Let's say:\n\n- The age of Q is \\( q \\)\n- The age of R is \\( r \\)\n- The age of T is \\( t \\)\n\nFrom the problem, we have two key pieces of information:\n\n1. Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This means the difference between R's age and Q's age is the same as the difference between Q's age and T's age. Mathematically, this can be written as:\n   \\[\n   r - q = q - t\n   \\]\n   Rearranging this equation, we get:\n   \\[\n   r + t = 2q\n   \\]\n\n2. The sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   r + t = 50\n   \\]\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\( r + t = 2q \\)\n2. \\( r + t = 50 \\)\n\nSince both equations are equal to \\( r + t \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n   \\[\n   2q = 50\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( q \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   q = \\frac{50}{2} = 25\n   \\]\n\nSo, Q's age is 25 years.

To find the difference between R's age and Q's age, we need to express \\( r \\) in terms of \\( t \\) or vice versa.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   - Let the speed of the ship be \\( v \\) miles per hour.\n   - The speed of the plane is \\( 10v \\) miles per hour.\n   - The ship has already traveled 180 miles before the plane starts.\n\n2. **Time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles:**\n   - Time taken by the ship to travel 180 miles is \\( \\frac{180}{v} \\) hours.\n\n3. **Distance traveled by the plane in the same time:**\n   - In the same \\( \\frac{180}{v} \\) hours, the plane travels \\( 10v \\times \\frac{180}{v} = 1800 \\) miles.\n\n4. **Total distance traveled by the ship after the plane starts:**\n   - After the plane starts, the ship continues to travel at speed \\( v \\) for the remaining distance until it meets the plane.\n   - The total distance traveled by the ship when they meet is \\( 180 + d \\), where \\( d \\) is the distance traveled by the ship after the plane starts.\n\n5. **Distance traveled by the plane when they meet:**\n   - The plane travels \\( d \\) miles to meet the ship.\n\n6. **Total distance traveled by the plane when they meet:**\n   - The total distance traveled by the plane is \\( 1800 + d \\).\n\n7. **Set up the equation:**\n   - Since they meet at the same point, the time taken by the ship to travel \\( 180 + d \\) miles is the same as the time taken by the plane to travel \\( 1800 + d \\) miles.\n   - Therefore, \\( \\frac{180 + d}{v} = \\frac{1800 + d}{10v} \\).\n\n8. **Solve for \\( d \\):**\n   - Cross-multiply to get \\( 10(180 + d) = 1800 + d \\).\n   - Simplify: \\( 1800 + 10d = 1800 + d \\).\n   - Subtract 1800 from both sides: \\( 10d = d \\).\n   - Subtract \\( d \\) from both sides: \\( 9d = 0 \\).\n   - Divide by 9: \\( d = 0 \\).\n\n9. **Calculate the total distance from the starting point:**\n   - The total distance from the starting point is \\( 180 + d = 180 + 0 = 180 \\) miles.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\(\\boxed{E}\\)."}

The hint should be short and to the point, focusing on the key information needed to solve the problem.\n\nHere is an example question and the corresponding hint:\n\nQuestion: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400.\n\nOptions:\nA)226\n<MSK>)230\nC)240\nD)260\nE)280\n\nYour reasoning: They make 420 units per month for 12 months, so in a year they sell 420 * 12 = 5040 components. Production cost per unit is 110, so total yearly cost is 5040 * 110 = 554400. Let p be the selling price per component. Yearly revenue is 5040p, so profit is 5040p - 554400. We need 5040p - 554400 >= 626400, so 5040p >= 1180800 and p >= 1180800 / 5040 = 234.3. The closest answer choice to that number is 230, so the correct answer is <MSK>.\n\nYour answer: <MSK>\nCorrect answer: C\n <intext tip> <MSK> is the closest answer choice, but it does not match the calculated value of 234.3.

This is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\), which represents the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) elements from a set of \\( n \\) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \\( n = 6 \\) and \\( k = 4 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = \\frac{6!}{4!2!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5}{2 \\times 1} = 15\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 15 different ways to choose 4 points out of 6. However, we need to ensure that these combinations form valid quadrilaterals. Since the points A, B, C, D, and E form a regular pentagon and F is the center, any set of 4 points chosen from these 6 will form a quadrilateral unless all 4 points are from the pentagon (since the center F would then be included, and the points would not form a quadrilateral but a pentagon with a point inside).\n\nThe number of ways to choose 4 points out of the 5 points A, B, C, D, and E is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{4} = \\frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \\frac{5!}{4!1!} = \\frac{5}{1} = 5\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 5 sets of 4 points that are all from the pentagon and do not form a quadrilateral with F. Therefore, the number of valid quadrilaterals is:\n\n\\[\n15 - 5 = 10\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).","full_output":"To determine the number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F (where F is the center of the regular pentagon ABCDE), we need to consider all possible combinations of these points taken 4 at a time.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 points out of 6.

What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400.\n\nOptions:\nA)226\nB)230\nC)240\n<MSK>)260\nE)280\n\nYour reasoning: They make 420 units per month for 12 months, so in a year they sell 420 * 12 = 5040 components. Production cost per unit is 110, so total yearly cost is 5040 * 110 = 554400. Let p be the selling price per component. Yearly revenue is 5040p, so profit is 5040p - 554400. We need 5040p - 554400 >= 626400, so 5040p >= 1180800 and p >= 1180800 / 5040 = 234.3. The closest answer choice to that number is 230, so the correct answer is B.\n\nYour answer: B\nCorrect answer: C\n <int>"}

To exclude the highest and lowest scores from the results, we need to subtract from the sum of all scores the highest and lowest scores, whose sum is 2x. Hence, the correct answer is (zy - 2x)/(z - 2).\n Your answer: A\nCorrect answer: D\n <int>Example 4:\n Question: A phone has a marked price of $200.

What is the final price the customer pays?\n\n Options:\nA)180\nB)185\n<MSK>)189\nD)190\nE)195\n\nYour reasoning: The marked price is 200. A 10% discount is 20, so the discounted price is 200 - 20 = 180. Then a 5% sales tax is 5% of the original 200, which is 10, so add 10 to 180 to get 190.

If it sells 500 bags of ice, how much total profit does it make?\n\nOptions:\nA)125\nB)150\nC)225\nD)250\nE)275","chain_of_thought":"To determine the total profit made by the grocery from selling 500 bags of ice, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the cost price of one bag of ice:**\n   The selling price of one bag of ice is $1.25, and the grocery makes a 20% profit on this selling price. Let \\( C \\) be the cost price of one bag of ice. The profit is 20% of the cost price, so the selling price is 120% of the cost price. Therefore, we can write the equation:\n   \\[\n   1.25 = 1.20 \\times C\n   \\]\n   Solving for \\( C \\):\n   \\[\n   C = \\frac{1.25}{1.20} = \\frac{1.25 \\times 100}{1.20 \\times 100} = \\frac{125}{120} = \\frac{25}{24} \\approx 1.0417\n   \\]\n   So, the cost price of one bag of ice is approximately $1.0417.\n\n2. **Calculate the profit per bag of ice:**\n   The profit per bag of ice is the selling price minus the cost price:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit per bag} = 1.25 - 1.0417 = 0.2083\n   \\]\n   So, the profit per bag of ice is approximately $0.2083.\n\n3. **Calculate the total profit for 500 bags of ice:**\n   The total profit for selling 500 bags of ice is the profit per bag multiplied by 500:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total profit} = 0.2083 \\times 500 = 104.165\n   \\]\n   Rounding to the nearest whole number, the total profit is $104.17, which is closest to $104.17, but since we are asked for the correct option letter, we need to find the closest option to $104.17. The closest option to $104.17 is $105, but since the options are in whole numbers, the closest option is $104, which is not listed. Therefore, we need to find the closest option to $104.17, which is $105, but since the options are in whole numbers, the closest option is $104, which is not listed.
