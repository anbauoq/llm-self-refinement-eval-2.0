If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family?\n\nOptions:\nA)2\nB)3\nC)4\nD)5\nE)6","chain_of_thought":"To determine the number of members in the family, we need to consider the given information: the total income per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000. The median income is the middle value when the incomes are arranged in ascending order. Let's analyze the possible scenarios for different family sizes.\n\n1. **If the family has 2 members:**\n   - The median income would be the average of the two incomes, which cannot be $3000$ unless both incomes are $3000$. However, the total income would be $3000 + 3000 = 6000$, which is less than $9000$. Therefore, this is not possible.\n\n2. **If the family has 3 members:**\n   - The median income would be the income of the middle member, which is $3000$. Let's denote the incomes of the three members as $a \\leq 3000 \\leq b \\leq c$. The total income is $a + 3000 + c = 9000$. This simplifies to $a + c = 6000$. This is possible, for example, if the incomes are $1000, 3000, 5000$.\n\n3. **If the family has 4 members:**\n   - The median income would be the average of the two middle incomes, which is $3000$. Let's denote the incomes of the four members as $a \\leq b \\leq 3000 \\leq c \\leq d$. The total income is $a + b + 3000 + c = 9000$. This simplifies to $a + b + c = 6000$. This is possible, for example, if the incomes are $1000, 2000, 3000, 3000$.\n\n4. **If the family has 5 members:**\n   - The median income would be the income of the middle member, which is $3000$. Let's denote the incomes of the five members as $a \\leq b \\leq 3000 \\leq d \\leq e$. The total income is $a + b + 3000 + d + e = 9000$. This simplifies to $a + b + d + e = 6000$. This is possible, for example, if the incomes are $1000, 2000, 3000, 3000, 2000$.\n\n5. **If the family has 6 members:**\n   - The median income would be the average of the third and fourth incomes, which is $3000$. Let's denote the incomes of the six members as $a \\leq b \\leq c \\leq 3000 \\leq d \\leq e$. The total income is $a + b + c + 3000 + d + e = 9000$. This simplifies to $a + b + c + d + e = 6000$. This is possible, for example, if the incomes are $1000, 2000, 3000, 3000, 3000, 3000$.\n\nFrom the above analysis, we see that the family can have 3, 4, 5, or 6 members. However, the problem asks for a single answer, and since all these scenarios are possible, we need to look at the options provided.
