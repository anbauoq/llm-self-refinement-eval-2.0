So, the question is about a train's journey duration when its speed changes partway through. Let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe train's original speed is 100 mph, and it takes 10 hours total. But after covering a quarter of the distance, it starts raining, and the speed drops to 75 mph. We need to find the total journey duration with this slowdown.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the total distance of the journey. If the train was going at 100 mph for 10 hours, the total distance would be speed multiplied by time, right? So 100 * 10 = 1000 miles. Wait, that seems really long, but maybe that's correct. Let me check again. Yeah, 100 mph for 10 hours is 1000 miles total. So the total distance is 1000 miles.\n\nNow, the train covers a quarter of that distance before the rain starts. A quarter of 1000 miles is 250 miles. So the first part of the trip is 250 miles at 100 mph, and the remaining distance is 1000 - 250 = 750 miles at 75 mph.\n\n<think>\nOkay, let's see.

The formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is S_n = a_1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a_1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nSo here, a_1 is 128, r is 1/2, and n is 10. Plugging those into the formula: S_10 = 128 * (1 - (1/2)^10) / (1 - 1/2). Let me compute that step by step. First, calculate (1/2)^10. That's 1 divided by 2^10. 2^10 is 1024, so (1/2)^10 is 1/1024. Then 1 - 1/1024 is 1023/1024. The denominator is 1 - 1/2, which is 1/2. So now the equation becomes 128\n\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about a car's depreciation.

So, the company makes 420 units each month, right? And each unit costs $110 to produce. They want to find the minimum selling price per component so that the yearly profit is at least $626,400. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand profit. Profit is revenue minus costs. So, revenue is the number of units sold times the selling price per unit. The cost is the number of units produced times the cost per unit. Since they produce and sell all components each month, the yearly production and sales would be the same as monthly multiplied by 12.\n\nLet me break it down. Monthly production is 420 units. So yearly, that's 420 * 12 months. Let me calculate that. 420 times 12. Let's see, 400*12=4800 and 20*12=240, so total is 4800+240=5040 units per year.\n\nThe total production cost per year would be 5040 units * $110 each. Let me compute that. 5040 * 100 is 504,000, and 5040 *10 is 50,400. So total cost is 504,000 +\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, so I need to solve this problem where a car is driving towards a wall at 3c, then turns around and goes back at 7c. They start at the same time, and I have to find the ratio of the time it takes the car to reach the wall the first time versus the second time. Hmm, let me think.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. The car is moving towards the wall at a speed of 3c, where c is some unit of speed. Then it turns around and goes back at 7c. The key here is that the distances might be different each time because the car is moving towards the wall and then back. Wait, but the wall is stationary, right? So the first time, the car is approaching the wall, and the second time, it's moving away from the wall after turning around. But wait, no—if it turns around, does it go back towards the original starting point or away from the wall? The problem says \"goes back,\" so maybe it's going back towards the starting point after reaching the wall. But maybe the wall is just a point, so when the car reaches the wall, turns around, and goes back at 7\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's see.

So, if the total number produced is, say, N, then 10% of N are defective, and the remaining 90% are non-defective. But then, it also mentions that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. Wait, so even though some staplers are defective, there's a mistake where 2% of the non-defective ones get rejected. And they tell us that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected. So I need to find N.\n\nLet me structure this. Let's define:\n\nTotal staplers = N.\n\nDefective = 10% of N = 0.10N.\n\nNon-defective = N - 0.10N = 0.90N.\n\nNow, of these non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake.

The problem is about finding the monthly sales needed for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500. Her salary is made up of a fixed part and a commission part. The fixed salary is $500, and then she gets 5% of all her monthly sales. So, we need to figure out how much she needs to sell so that when you add 5% of that sales amount to the $500, the total is $1500.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. The total salary S is equal to 500 plus 5% of the sales. Let's call the sales amount 'X'. So the equation would be S = 500 + 0.05X. We want S to be at least $1500. Wait, the question says \"reaches $1500\", so we need exactly $1500. So set S equal to 1500 and solve for X.\n\nSo substituting, 1500 = 500 + 0.05X.

Wait, the time isn't entirely in hours; part of it is in minutes. I need to convert those 15 minutes into hours to make the units match. Because the speed is per hour, so the time should also be in hours to give the correct distance in miles.\n\nLet me think about converting minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is a fraction of an hour. To convert minutes to hours, you divide the number of minutes by 60. So 15 divided by 60.

The question is about finding the number of ways to choose 2 oranges from a basket that has 10 oranges. Hmm, this sounds like a combinations problem. Wait, combinations or permutations? Right, when the order doesn't matter, it's combinations. Because choosing orange A and orange B is the same as choosing B and A. So I need to use the combination formula here.\n\nThe combination formula is n choose k, which is n! divided by (k! times (n - k)!). So in this case, n is 10 and k is 2. Let me plug those numbers in. \n\nCalculating 10 choose 2: 10! divided by (2! * (10-2)!). Simplify that. 10! is 10 × 9 × 8! so the 8! cancels out with the denominator's 8!.

The problem is about Julie's yard, which is rectangular. One side is 100 feet wide, and the total area is 3,000 square feet. We need to find the length of the other side. Hmm.\n\nAlright, so I remember that the area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. The formula is Area = length × width. So if one side is 100 feet, that would be either the length or the width. The other side is what we need to find.\n\nWait, the problem says \"one side of the yard is 100 feet wide.\" So maybe that's the width. Then the length is the other side we need to find. The area is given as 3,000 square feet. So using the formula, if area is length times width, then length would be area divided by width.\n\nLet me write that down. Let's denote the known width as 100 feet, and the area as 3,000 sq ft. So the unknown side, which is the length, would be 3,000 divided by 100. Let me calculate that. 3,000 divided by 100 is 30.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, let's figure out Raj's age 5 years ago. Since Raj is 17 now, five years ago he would have been 17 - 5 = 12 years old. \n\nThe problem states that at that time (5 years ago), Raj's age was one-third of Rahim's age. So, if Raj was 12 then, Rahim's age back then would be three times Raj's age then. Let me write that as an equation. Let R be Rahim's current age. Five years ago, Rahim was R - 5 years old. According to the problem, 12 = (1/3)(R - 5). \n\nSo solving for R: Multiply both sides by 3. 12 * 3 = 36 = R - 5. Then, add 5 to both sides: 36 + 5 = 41.\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's see.

The problem is about M men agreeing to buy a gift that costs Rs. D. Then, if 3 men drop out, how much more will each remaining man have to contribute. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer from the options given.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem step by step. Initially, there are M men planning to split the cost of the gift, which is D rupees. So, each man's original contribution would be D divided by M, right? So original contribution per person is D/M.\n\nNow, if 3 men drop out, the number of men remaining is M minus 3. So, the new number of contributors is (M - 3). The total cost of the gift hasn't changed; it's still D rupees. Therefore, the new contribution per person would be D divided by (M - 3), which is D/(M - 3).\n\nThe question asks how much more each will have to contribute. So, the increase per person is the new contribution minus the original contribution. That would be D/(M - 3) - D/M.\n\nLet me compute that. To subtract these fractions, they need a common denominator. The common denominator of M and (\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, we have a function f(x) = 3x² - 2x + 1, and we need to find the equation of the tangent line to its graph at the point where x = 2. Hmm, tangent lines... I remember that the tangent line at a point requires two things: the slope at that point and a point through which the tangent line passes. Right, the equation of a line is usually y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. But since we have a specific point, maybe we can use the point-slope form instead, which is y - y1 = m(x - x1). That might be easier because we can plug in the slope and the point directly.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope. The slope of the tangent line to the function at a particular x-value is the derivative of the function evaluated at that x-value. So, I need to compute f'(x) first. The function f(x) is a quadratic, so its derivative should be straightforward. Let's differentiate term by term:\n\nThe derivative of 3x² is 6x, using the power rule (bring down the exponent as a coefficient,\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's see.

There must be a formula or a smarter way to do this instead of adding each one manually.\n\nWait, I think there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Let me recall. The formula for the sum S of the first n terms of an arithmetic progression is S = n/2 * (first term + last term). Right. So I need to figure out how many terms there are that are divisible by 3 up to 100, then apply this formula.\n\nFirst, let's find the first term.

So, I need to figure out all the possible ways to get 3 heads out of 5 flips and then divide that by the total number of possible outcomes.\n\nFirst, the total number of outcomes when flipping a coin 5 times. Since each flip has 2 possibilities, heads or tails, the total should be 2^5. Let me calculate that. 2*2=4, 4*2=8, 8*2=16, 16*2=32. So 32 total possible outcomes. That part makes sense.\n\nNow, the number of ways to get exactly 3 heads. This sounds like a combination problem.

We need to find the number of employees.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the terms. 1 lakh is 100,000, so 6 lakh is 600,000. Similarly, 6.24 lakh is 624,000. So the original total contribution is 600,000, and with an extra 60 per person, it becomes 624,000.\n\nLet’s denote the number of employees as N. Let the original contribution per employee be C. So, according to the first scenario, N multiplied by C equals 600,000. So equation 1: N * C = 600,000.\n\nIn the second scenario, each employee contributes C + 60, and the total becomes 624,000. So equation 2: N * (C + 60) = 624,000.\n\nWe need to solve these two equations to find N. Let's subtract equation 1 from equation 2 to eliminate N. So:\n\nN*(C +60\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking about the probability of getting at least one six when rolling a die three times. Hmm, probability questions can be tricky sometimes, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is exactly asking. \"At least one six\" means that in three rolls, we could get one six, two sixes, or all three sixes. Calculating the probability for each of these scenarios and adding them up might be one way, but that could get complicated. Wait, there's a smarter approach. Often, when a problem asks for the probability of \"at least one\" occurrence, it's easier to calculate the complement probability—that is, the probability of the event not happening at all—and then subtracting it from 1. That should give the desired probability.\n\nSo, in this case, the complement of getting at least one six is getting no sixes in all three rolls. If I can find the probability of not rolling a six each time, then raise that to the power of three (since the rolls are independent), that should give me the probability of no sixes in three rolls. Then subtracting that value from 1 will give the probability of getting at least one six\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The question is: \"Now return ONLY single final answer to the question inside <ans> </ans>.\" Hmm, so the user wants me to provide the final answer inside a single pair of angle brackets, specifically <ans>, and make sure there's only that as the output.

We need to find the width of the path. Hmm, alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the garden itself is a rectangle. The area of the garden would be length times width.

The problem is about finding the cover price per issue of a magazine. So, the information given is that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and this amount represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. Hmm, I need to parse that correctly.\n\nFirst, let's break down what's being asked. The subscription price is $42 for 15 issues. This total is a saving compared to buying the individual cover prices. The saving is 25%, which I think means that buying the subscription instead of individual copies saves you 25% off the total cover price. Wait, so the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price? Because if you save 25%, then you pay 75% of the original price.\n\nSo, if the total cover price for 15 issues would be, let's call it C, then the subscription price is 75% of C. And that equals $42. So mathematically, 0.75 * C = 42. Then to find C, we can divide 42 by 0.75.

But wait, the equation given is x² + y² = z². So z would be the hypotenuse here. But the problem states 0 < x < y < 30. Wait, does that mean x, y, and z are all less than 30? Or just x and y?

I need to find the length of the longer piece. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nHmm, let's see. Let me denote the length of the longer piece as something. Let's say the longer piece is x meters. Then the shorter piece would be x minus 3 meters because it's 3 meters shorter. Since the total length is 20 meters, the sum of both pieces should equal 20. So, I can set up an equation: x (the longer piece) plus (x - 3) (the shorter piece) equals 20. \n\nPutting that together: x + (x - 3) = 20. Let me simplify that. Combine like terms: x + x is 2x, and then minus 3. So, 2x - 3 = 20. Now, I need to solve for x. \n\nAdding 3 to both sides: 2x = 23. Then divide both sides by 2: x = 23/2. That's 11.5.

Wait, the problem says \"of the remaining revenue, 1/3 was from the sale of biographies.\" So the remaining revenue after novels is 66%, and out of that 66%, 1/3 is biographies.

Normally, odometers go from 1 to 999..., but this one skips any number with a 4. So each digit can only be 0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9 except for the first digit, which can't be 0 or 4 either. Wait, actually, the first digit (hundreds place) can't be 0 or 4, right? Because numbers like 04 are skipped. So the first digit can be 1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9. Then the other digits can be 0,1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9. So each digit has 8 possibilities except when the first digit, which has 8 possibilities as well (since it can't","predicted_answer":null,"ground_truth":"B","is_correct":null,"was_retried":true}

The problem is about the average weight of oarsmen increasing when a new man replaces an old one. The original crew has 10 members. The average weight goes up by 1.8 kg when the 53 kg guy is replaced by the new guy. We need to find the new man's weight.\n\nHmm, let's start by recalling that average weight is total weight divided by the number of people. So, initially, the average is total_initial / 10. After replacement, the average becomes total_final / 10, and this final average is 1.8 kg more than the initial.\n\nWait, but how does replacing one person affect the total weight? The difference between the new man's weight and the old man's weight will change the total weight. Let's denote the new man's weight as W. So, the total weight after replacement is the original total minus 53 kg plus W. The new total is original_total + (W - 53).\n\nThe increase in average is 1.8 kg per person, over 10 people, so the total increase in weight is 1.8 * 10 = 18 kg. That means the new total weight is 18 kg more than the original total. So, the\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the number of integers between 1 and 1000 inclusive that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7. Hmm. I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principle for these kinds of problems. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, maybe I should find how many numbers are divisible by 3, then by 5, then by 7, and add those up. But wait, if I just add them, there might be overlaps—numbers divisible by more than one of these. So I need to subtract the overlaps. Right, inclusion-exclusion.\n\nSo the formula would be: |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| - |A ∩ B| - |A ∩ C| - |B ∩ C| + |A ∩ B ∩ C|. Where A, B, C are the sets of numbers divisible by 3, 5, 7 respectively.\n\nAlright, let's compute each part.\n\nFirst, |A|: numbers divisible by 3 from 1 to 1000. That's floor(1000/3).

The problem is about finding the cost of B bottles of soda in dollars when 27 bottles cost A cents. Hmm, I need to figure out the right formula here.\n\nFirst, the given information is that 27 bottles cost A cents. So, the cost per bottle would be A cents divided by 27, right? So each bottle is A/27 cents. Then, if someone wants to buy B bottles, the total cost in cents would be B multiplied by (A/27). That gives (B*A)/27 cents.\n\nBut the question asks for the price in dollars. Since 1 dollar is 100 cents, I need to convert that total cents amount into dollars. To convert cents to dollars, you divide by 100. So, the cost in dollars would be ((B*A)/27) / 100. Simplifying that, it's (B*A)/(27*100) which is (B*A)/2700.\n\nNow let me check the options.

So, we have a cube with an edge length of 1, and there's a regular tetrahedron inside it. The tetrahedron touches all the faces of the cube. We need to find the surface area of this tetrahedron.\n\nHmm, first, I should recall what a regular tetrahedron is. A regular tetrahedron has all four faces as equilateral triangles, and all edges are equal in length. So, if I can find the length of one edge of the tetrahedron, I can compute the area of one face and then multiply by four to get the total surface area.\n\nThe cube has edge length 1, so each face of the cube is a 1x1 square. The tetrahedron touches all the faces of the cube. I need to visualize how a regular tetrahedron can fit inside a cube and touch all its faces.

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that if a number is divisible by 14, it's automatically divisible by 7 because 14 is 2 times 7. So the problem is asking for numbers divisible by 7 but excluding those that are also divisible by 14. That makes sense. So essentially, I need to count all numbers divisible by 7 and then subtract those that are divisible by both 7 and 14, which are the numbers divisible by 14.\n\nWait, right. So the count should be (number of multiples of 7) minus (number of multiples of 14). Let me verify that. For example, numbers divisible by 7 are 7, 14, 21, 28, etc. Numbers divisible by 14 are 14, 28, 42, etc. So subtracting those from the multiples of 7 leaves the numbers divisible by 7 but not by 14.
