So, the question is about a train's journey duration when its speed changes partway through. Let me read the problem again to make sure I get all the details right.\n\nThe train's original speed is 100 mph, and it takes 10 hours total. But after covering a quarter of the distance, it starts raining, and the speed drops to 75 mph. We need to find the total journey duration with this slowdown.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the total distance of the journey. If the train was going at 100 mph for 10 hours, the total distance would be speed multiplied by time, right? So 100 * 10 = 1000 miles. Wait, that seems really long, but maybe that's correct. Let me check again. Yeah, 100 mph for 10 hours is 1000 miles total. So the total distance is 1000 miles.\n\nNow, the train covers a quarter of that distance before the rain starts. A quarter of 1000 miles is 250 miles. So the first part of the trip is 250 miles at 100 mph, and the remaining distance is 1000 - 250 = 750 miles at 75 mph.\n\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the sum of the first 10 terms of a geometric sequence where the first term is 128 and the common ratio is 1/2. Hmm, geometric sequences... right. The formula for the sum of the first n terms of a geometric series is S_n = a_1 * (1 - r^n) / (1 - r), where a_1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the number of terms.\n\nSo here, a_1 is 128, r is 1/2, and n is 10. Plugging those into the formula: S_10 = 128 * (1 - (1/2)^10) / (1 - 1/2). Let me compute that step by step. First, calculate (1/2)^10. That's 1 divided by 2^10. 2^10 is 1024, so (1/2)^10 is 1/1024. Then 1 - 1/1024 is 1023/1024. The denominator is 1 - 1/2, which is 1/2. So now the equation becomes 128\n\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about a car's depreciation.

Got that part.\n\nNow, after covering a quarter of the distance, it starts raining. A quarter of 1000 miles is 250 miles. So, the train travels the first 250 miles at 100 mph. How long does that take? Time is distance divided by speed, so 250 / 100 = 2.5 hours. \n\nThen, the remaining distance is 1000 - 250 = 750 miles. But now the speed is 75 mph.

So, the company makes 420 units each month, right? And each unit costs $110 to produce. They want to find the minimum selling price per component so that the yearly profit is at least $626,400. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand profit. Profit is revenue minus costs. So, revenue is the number of units sold times the selling price per unit. The cost is the number of units produced times the cost per unit. Since they produce and sell all components each month, the yearly production and sales would be the same as monthly multiplied by 12.\n\nLet me break it down. Monthly production is 420 units. So yearly, that's 420 * 12 months. Let me calculate that. 420 times 12. Let's see, 400*12=4800 and 20*12=240, so total is 4800+240=5040 units per year.\n\nThe total production cost per year would be 5040 units * $110 each.

Then it turns around and goes back at 7c. The key here is that the distances might be different each time because the car is moving towards the wall and then back. Wait, but the wall is stationary, right? So the first time, the car is approaching the wall, and the second time, it's moving away from the wall after turning around. But wait, no—if it turns around, does it go back towards the original starting point or away from the wall?

Replacing 15% of the solution means removing 15% of the current mixture and adding milk. Since the mixture is uniform, the removed part has the same concentration as the current solution.

The problem is about finding the monthly sales needed for the shop assistant's salary to reach $1500. Her salary is made up of a fixed part and a commission part. The fixed salary is $500, and then she gets 5% of all her monthly sales. So, we need to figure out how much she needs to sell so that when you add 5% of that sales amount to the $500, the total is $1500.\n\nHmm, let's break it down. The total salary S is equal to 500 plus 5% of the sales. Let's call the sales amount 'X'. So the equation would be S = 500 + 0.05X. We want S to be at least $1500. Wait, the question says \"reaches $1500\", so we need exactly $1500. So set S equal to 1500 and solve for X.\n\nSo substituting, 1500 = 500 + 0.05X.

Wait, the time isn't entirely in hours; part of it is in minutes. I need to convert those 15 minutes into hours to make the units match. Because the speed is per hour, so the time should also be in hours to give the correct distance in miles.\n\nLet me think about converting minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 minutes is a fraction of an hour. To convert minutes to hours, you divide the number of minutes by 60. So 15 divided by 60. Let me calculate that. 15 ÷ 60 = 0.25 hours. Oh, right, because 15 minutes is a quarter of an hour. So 15 minutes is 0.25 hours.

So, the question is about determining the minimum sample size needed for a proportion estimate with a 95% confidence level and a 4% margin of error. The population proportion is estimated to be around 50%. Hmm, I remember there's a formula for calculating the sample size for proportions. Let me recall.\n\nFirst, the formula for sample size in estimating a population proportion is n = (Z^2 * p * q) / E^2, where Z is the z-score corresponding to the confidence level, p is the estimated proportion, q is 1 - p, and E is the margin of error. Since the confidence level is 95%, the Z-score should be 1.96. The margin of error E is 4%, so 0.04. The estimated proportion p is 0.5 because that's the worst-case scenario, maximizing the product p*q.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: n = (1.96^2 * 0.5 * 0.5) / 0.04^2.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. First, let's figure out Raj's age 5 years ago. Since Raj is 17 now, five years ago he would have been 17 - 5 = 12 years old. \n\nThe problem states that at that time (5 years ago), Raj's age was one-third of Rahim's age.

According to the problem, 12 = (1/3)(R - 5). \n\nSo solving for R: Multiply both sides by 3. 12 * 3 = 36 = R - 5. Then, add 5 to both sides: 36 + 5 = 41.\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's see.

The problem is about M men agreeing to buy a gift that costs Rs. D. Then, if 3 men drop out, how much more will each remaining man have to contribute. Hmm, I need to figure out the correct answer from the options given.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem step by step. Initially, there are M men planning to split the cost of the gift, which is D rupees. So, each man's original contribution would be D divided by M, right? So original contribution per person is D/M.\n\nNow, if 3 men drop out, the number of men remaining is M minus 3. So, the new number of contributors is (M - 3).

Therefore, the new contribution per person would be D divided by (M - 3), which is D/(M - 3).\n\nThe question asks how much more each will have to contribute.

So, we have a function f(x) = 3x² - 2x + 1, and we need to find the equation of the tangent line to its graph at the point where x = 2. Hmm, tangent lines... I remember that the tangent line at a point requires two things: the slope at that point and a point through which the tangent line passes. Right, the equation of a line is usually y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. But since we have a specific point, maybe we can use the point-slope form instead, which is y - y1 = m(x - x1). That might be easier because we can plug in the slope and the point directly.\n\nFirst, let's find the slope. The slope of the tangent line to the function at a particular x-value is the derivative of the function evaluated at that x-value. So, I need to compute f'(x) first.

So the organization wants to raise 6 lakh rupees by collecting equal contributions from each employee. If each employee contributed 60 rupees extra, the total would be 6.24 lakh. We need to find the number of employees.\n\nFirst, let's make sure I understand the terms. 1 lakh is 100,000, so 6 lakh is 600,000. Similarly, 6.24 lakh is 624,000. So the original total contribution is 600,000, and with an extra 60 per person, it becomes 624,000.\n\nLet’s denote the number of employees as N. Let the original contribution per employee be C. So, according to the first scenario, N multiplied by C equals 600,000. So equation 1: N * C = 600,000.\n\nIn the second scenario, each employee contributes C + 60, and the total becomes 624,000.

Calculating the probability for each of these scenarios and adding them up might be one way, but that could get complicated. Wait, there's a smarter approach. Often, when a problem asks for the probability of \"at least one\" occurrence, it's easier to calculate the complement probability—that is, the probability of the event not happening at all—and then subtracting it from 1. That should give the desired probability.\n\nSo, in this case, the complement of getting at least one six is getting no sixes in all three rolls. If I can find the probability of not rolling a six each time, then raise that to the power of three (since the rolls are independent), that should give me the probability of no sixes in three rolls. Then subtracting that value from 1 will give the probability of getting at least one six\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's see.

So setting up the equation 504/M = 420/800. Then cross-multiplying: 504 * 800 = 420 * M. Then solving for M would be (504 * 800)/420. Let me compute that.\n\nFirst, simplify the numbers. 504 divided by 420. Let's see, both are divisible by 42. 504 ÷ 42 is 12, and 420 ÷ 42 is 10. So 504/420 = 12/10 =\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's see.

The problem is about finding the cover price per issue of a magazine. So, the information given is that a subscription for 15 issues costs $42.00, and this amount represents a saving of 25% of the cover prices. Hmm, I need to parse that correctly.\n\nFirst, let's break down what's being asked. The subscription price is $42 for 15 issues. This total is a saving compared to buying the individual cover prices. The saving is 25%, which I think means that buying the subscription instead of individual copies saves you 25% off the total cover price. Wait, so the subscription price is 75% of the total cover price? Because if you save 25%, then you pay 75% of the original price.\n\nSo, if the total cover price for 15 issues would be, let's call it C, then the subscription price is 75% of C. And that equals $42. So mathematically, 0.75 * C = 42. Then to find C, we can divide 42 by 0.75.

And traditionally, a and b are the legs, and c is the hypotenuse. But in the problem, they mention x and y, so I guess x and y are the legs, and z would be the hypotenuse. But wait, the equation given is x² + y² = z². So z would be the hypotenuse here. But the problem states 0 < x < y < 30. Wait, does that mean x, y, and z are all less than 30? Or just x and y?

The subscription cost is $42 for 15 issues. This amount is a saving compared to buying each cover price individually. The saving is 25% of the cover prices. So, buying the subscription instead of buying each issue separately saves 25% on the total cover price.\n\nLet me break it down. Let's denote the cover price per issue as P. If you buy 15 issues individually, the total cost would be 15P. However, the subscription costs $42, which is 25% less than the total cover price. That means the subscription price is 75% of the original total cover price. Because a 25% saving implies you pay 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.\n\nSo, mathematically, 75% of (15P) equals $42. Because the subscription is the discounted price. So, 0.75 * 15P = 42.

Let's say the longer piece is x meters. Then the shorter piece would be x minus 3 meters because it's 3 meters shorter. Since the total length is 20 meters, the sum of both pieces should equal 20. So, I can set up an equation: x (the longer piece) plus (x - 3) (the shorter piece) equals 20. \n\nPutting that together: x + (x - 3) = 20. Let me simplify that.

The model might have converted seconds to minutes incorrectly or miscalculated the rate.\n\nWait, the rate is w/25 gallons per x seconds. So the time per gallon would be x/(w/25) seconds per gallon, which is (25x)/w seconds per gallon. Then for y gallons, the time in seconds is y * (25x)/w. Converting seconds to minutes by dividing by 60 gives (25xy)/(60w) = (5xy)/(12w) minutes. That would be option <MSK>. But the model chose A, which is y/(1200xy). That seems way off. How did they get that?\n\nMaybe the model inverted the rate. If they thought the rate was x/"}

When 9 is subtracted from each, the new ratio becomes 12:23. We need to find the smaller number. The options are A to E. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the original ratio is 3:5. Let me denote the two numbers as 3x and 5x, where x is a common multiplier. That makes sense because ratios can be represented by multiples of a common variable. So, the actual numbers are 3x and 5x. The smaller number here is 3x, which we need to find.\n\nNow, the problem states that when 9 is subtracted from each of these numbers, the new ratio becomes 12:23.

Let me start by setting up variables. Let's say the two numbers are 3k and 5k, where k is a common multiplier. That way, their ratio is 3:5, which fits the problem statement. So the original numbers are 3k and 5k. The smaller number here is 3k.\n\nNow, when we subtract 9 from each, the new numbers become (3k - 9) and (5k - 9). The problem states that these new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. So, I can set up a proportion here: (3k - 9)/(5k - 9) = 12/23.\n\nTo solve for k, I'll cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions.
