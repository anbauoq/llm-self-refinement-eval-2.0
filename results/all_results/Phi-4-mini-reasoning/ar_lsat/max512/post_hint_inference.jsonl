The problem is about a car and a truck moving towards each other. The car is going at 30 m/s and the truck at 40 m/s. The initial distance between them is 2800 meters. The question is asking how much time will elapse before they meet. Alright, so they're moving towards each other, which means their speeds add up, right?\n\nWait, so when two objects are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.

The question is asking about the probability that a randomly chosen integer between 1 and 30 is divisible by 2 or 3. Hmm, probability problems can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that when the problem says \"divisible by 2 or 3,\" it might be referring to the inclusion of numbers divisible by either 2 or 3. But I have to be careful here because some numbers are divisible by both 2 and 3, like 6, 12, etc. If I just add the numbers divisible by 2 and those by 3, I might be double-counting those that are divisible by both. So, I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. The formula should be: Number divisible by 2 + Number divisible by 3 - Number divisible by both 2 and 3. That way, we subtract the overlap to avoid double-counting.\n\nAlright, let's start by finding how many numbers between 1 and 30 are divisible by 2. Divisible by 2 means even numbers. From 1 to 30, every second number is even. So, 30 divided by 2 is 15. So there are 15 numbers divisible by 2.\n\nNext, numbers divisible by 3. To find this, we can divide 30 by 3. 30 divided by 3 is 10. So there are 10 numbers between 1 and 30 divisible by 3.\n\nNow, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 are the numbers divisible by their least common multiple, which is 6. So, how many numbers between 1 and 30 are divisible by 6? 30 divided by 6 is 5. So that's 5 numbers.\n\nApplying the inclusion-exclusion principle: 15 (divisible by 2) + 10 (divisible by 3) - 5 (divisible by both) = 20. So there are 20 numbers between 1 and 30 that are divisible by 2 or 3.\n\nThe total number of integers chosen is 30. Therefore, the probability is the number of favorable outcomes (20) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (30). Simplifying that fraction, 20/30 reduces to 2/3. So the probability should be 2/3.\n\nWait, let me double-check. Let's list out the numbers","full_output":"<think>\n\nOkay, let's try to tackle this problem step by step. The question is about determining which pair of students must give their reports on Wednesday if they are scheduled on the same day. The options are A to E, each pairing two students. Let me go through each condition and see how they affect the possible scheduling.\n\nFirst, let's list all the conditions again to make sure I don't miss anything:\n\n1. **George can only give a report on Tuesday.**\n   - So George is fixed on Tuesday. Any pair including George must be on Tuesday, but since the question is about pairs that must be on Wednesday, George can't be part of such a pair. So option A (George and Lenore) is out of the running because George is on Tuesday. So we can eliminate option A right away.\n\n2. **Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.**\n   - This means that on any day, if either Olivia or Robert is scheduled, their report must be in the morning. So if two students are on the same day, and one is Olivia or Robert, the other must be in the morning. But how does this affect their day? For example, if a pair includes Olivia, she must be in the morning of that day. However, the question is about which pair must be on Wednesday regardless of their specific time. So maybe this condition affects the possible days Olivia and Robert can be scheduled, but not directly the day they must be on. Hmm.\n\n3. **If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.**\n   - This is a crucial condition. Let's parse it. If Nina is on a day, the next day must have both Helen and Irving. Except if Nina is on Wednesday, then there's no restriction. So if Nina is on Monday, then Tuesday must have Helen and Irving. If Nina is on Tuesday, then Wednesday must have Helen and Irving. If Nina is on Wednesday, no one has a next day, so no restriction.\n\nNow, the question is asking for a pair that, if they are scheduled on the same day, must be on Wednesday. So we need to find two students whose scheduling on the same day can't be on Monday or Tuesday, hence must be on Wednesday.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option B: Helen and Nina**\n- If Helen and Nina are on the same day, when could that be? Let's consider possible days.\n\nCase 1: Nina is on Monday.\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is: \"If a car travels at a speed of 60 km/h, how long will it take to cover a distance of 300 kilometers?\" Alright, let's break this down step by step. \n\nFirst, I remember that speed, time, and distance are related by the formula: speed = distance / time. The problem gives us the speed and the distance, and we need to find the time. So, I think we need to rearrange the formula to solve for time. Let me recall... right, if speed is distance divided by time, then time should be distance divided by speed. That makes sense because time increases if the distance is longer or the speed is slower.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers: the distance is 300 km, and the speed is 60 km/h. Using the formula time = distance / speed, we get 300 divided by 60. Let me do that calculation. 300 divided by 60 is 5. So, the time taken should be 5 hours. Wait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nIs there any trick here? The units look consistent. The speed is in km per hour, and the distance is in kilometers, so the time should indeed be in hours. Dividing km by km/h gives hours, right? Because when you divide by a fraction, it's like multiplying by its reciprocal. So, 300 km divided by (60 km/h) equals 300/60 hours, which is 5 hours. Yep, that checks out.\n\nHmm, maybe another way to think about it. If the car is going 60 km every hour, how many hours does it take to go 300 km? So, 60 km in one hour, 120 in two, 180 in three, 240 in four, and 300 in five. That matches the calculation. So, five hours. \n\nI don't see any complications here. No stops, constant speed, straight distance. The problem seems to assume ideal conditions. So, the answer should be 5 hours. Alright, I think that's solid. No mistakes here. Just a simple application of the formula. Time is distance divided by speed. 300 divided by 60 equals 5. Yep.\n\n</think>\n\nThe time taken for the car to cover 300 kilometers is calculated using the formula:  \n**Time = Distance / Speed**  \nPlugging in the\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's see.

They have data that shows when the price is $5, they sell 10 cups an hour, and when the price is $7, they sell 6 cups. Hmm, so I need to figure out the best price between these points or maybe around them. \n\nFirst, I remember that revenue is price multiplied by quantity sold. So Revenue = Price × Quantity. The goal is to maximize this revenue. Since they gave two data points, maybe we can model the demand curve as a linear function and then find the maximum revenue point. \n\nLet me try to model the demand curve. When price (p) is $5, quantity (q) is 10. When p is $7, q is 6. So these are two points on the demand curve: (10,5) and (6,7). Wait, actually, usually demand curves are quantity as a function of price, so q = m*p + b. Let me find the equation of the line that connects these two points.\n\nThe slope (m) would be change in q over change in p. So from p=5 to p=7, that's a change of +2.

So the demand equation is q = -2p + 20.\n\nNow, revenue R is p*q, which is p*(-2p +20) = -2p² +20p. To find the maximum revenue, we can take the derivative of R with respect to p and set it to zero.

The problem is to find the number of integers between 1 and 1000 inclusive that are divisible by either 3 or 5 but not both. Hmm, right. So, I need to calculate how many numbers in that range are divisible by 3 or 5, but subtract those that are divisible by both because we don't want them counted twice. Wait, but the question says \"but not both,\" so actually, it's the numbers divisible by 3 or 5 minus twice the numbers divisible by both? Wait, no. Let me think again.\n\nThe standard inclusion-exclusion principle says that the number of elements in A union B is equal to the number in A plus the number in B minus the number in A intersect B. So, if I want numbers divisible by either 3 or 5, that's |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|. But the question specifies \"but not both,\" so we need to exclude the intersection entirely. So, actually, it would be (|A| + |B| - 2|A ∩ B|). Because normally inclusion-exclusion subtracts once, but since we want to exclude those in both, we subtract twice. Let me confirm that.\n\nSuppose A is divisible by 3, B by 5. Then A ∪ B includes all numbers in A or B. But the intersection A ∩ B is numbers in both.

So the formula should be the number of multiples of 3 plus the number of multiples of 5 minus twice the number of multiples of 15 (since 15 is the LCM of 3 and 5).\n\nSo first, let's find how many numbers between 1 and 1000 are divisible by 3. That's the floor of 1000 divided by 3. Similarly for 5, floor(1000/5). Then for 15, floor(1000/15).

The problem is to find the number of integers between 1 and 1000 inclusive that are divisible by either 3 or 5 but not both. Hmm, right. So I need to calculate how many numbers in that range are divisible by 3 or 5, but exclude those that are divisible by both. \n\nFirst, I remember that when dealing with \"either A or B but not both,\" it's similar to the inclusion-exclusion principle but subtracting the intersection twice. Wait, let me think. The standard inclusion-exclusion for A or B is |A| + |B| - |A∩B|. But if we want those that are in A or B but not both, that would be (|A| + |B| - 2|A∩B|). Because we subtract the intersection twice: once to remove the overlap in A and once in B. So yeah, that makes sense.\n\nSo, applying that here. Let's define A as numbers divisible by 3, B as numbers divisible by 5. Then the count we want is |A| + |B| - 2|A∩B|. \n\nFirst, find |A|. That's the number of multiples of 3 between 1 and 1000. To find that, divide 1000 by 3 and take the floor. So 1000 ÷ 3 is approximately 333.333... So floor(1000/3) is 333.

So 1000 ÷ 15 is approximately 66.666..., so floor(1000/15) is 66. Hence, 66 numbers divisible by both.\n\nPutting this into the formula: |A| + |B| - 2|A∩B| = 333 + 200 - 2*66. Let's compute that. 333 + 200 is 533. Then 2*66 is 132. So 533 - 132 is 401. So the answer should be 401.\n\nWait, but let me double","chain_of_thought":"<think>\n\nOkay, let's see.

The question is asking for the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 7 and leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 9. So, we need a number N such that:\n\n1. N ≡ 0 mod 7 (since it's divisible by 7)\n2. N ≡ 4 mod 9 (remainder 4 when divided by 9)\n\nHmm, how do I find such a number? Well, maybe I can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem here. Let me recall how that works. The Chinese Remainder Theorem helps solve systems of congruences when the moduli are coprime. In this case, 7 and 9 are coprime because their greatest common divisor is 1. So, that should work.\n\nSo, let's set up the equations:\n\nWe have N ≡ 0 mod 7 and N ≡ 4 mod 9. Let's express N in terms of one modulus and substitute into the other. Since N is divisible by 7, we can write N = 7k, where k is a positive integer. Now, substituting this into the second congruence:\n\n7k ≡ 4 mod 9\n\nNow, I need to solve for k here. To isolate k, I need the multiplicative inverse of 7 modulo 9. The inverse of 7 mod 9 is a number m such that 7m ≡ 1 mod 9. Let me find that inverse.\n\nTesting values:\n7*1 = 7 mod9 → 7\n7*2 = 14 mod9 → 5\n7*3 = 21 mod9 → 3\n7*4 = 28 mod9 → 1 (since 28 - 3*9=1)\nAh, so 7*4 ≡1 mod9. Therefore, the inverse of 7 mod9 is 4.\n\nNow, multiply both sides of the equation 7k ≡4 mod9 by 4:\n\nk ≡4*4 mod9\nk ≡16 mod9\n16 mod9 is 7 (since 9*1=9, 16-9=7), so k ≡7 mod9.\n\nThat means k can be written as k=9n +7 for some integer n ≥0.\n\nSubstituting back into N=7k:\n\nN=7*(9n +7)=\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is to find the sum of all positive integers less than 1000 that can be expressed as the product of exactly three prime numbers, where primes can be repeated. Hmm. Wait, exactly three prime factors, and repetition allowed. So, for example, if a number is like p*q*p, that's three primes multiplied together, right? So the prime factors count with multiplicity. So the task is to find all such numbers less than 1000, sum them up.\n\nFirst, I need to clarify the problem. The numbers must be the product of exactly three primes, which can be the same prime. So numbers like 2*2*2=8 would count, as well as 2*3*5=30. So both cases where primes are repeated and distinct. So, the prime factors counted with multiplicity are exactly three.\n\nSo the problem reduces to generating all numbers less than 1000 that are the product of three primes (with possible repetition) and then summing them. But we have to make sure not to include numbers that have more than three prime factors. For example, if a number is like p*p*p*p, that's four primes, so it would be excluded. So the key is that the number has exactly three prime factors when counted with multiplicity.\n\nSo, how to approach this? Let's think of the possible combinations of three primes. Since primes can be repeated, the primes can be the same or different. So we can have:\n\n1. All three primes the same: p^3\n2. Two primes the same and one different: p^2*q\n3. All primes different: p*q*r\n\nEach of these cases contributes numbers to the sum. So we need to generate all numbers of these forms that are less than 1000 and then sum them up, making sure there's no overlap (i.e., numbers that fit into more than one category). Wait, but p^3 could also be considered as part of other categories if there's overlap. Wait, no. For example, 2^3=8. If we consider 8 as p^3, it's a single prime cubed. But if we have numbers like 2*2*3=12, which is p^2*q, so different. So the three cases are distinct. So the sum would be the sum of numbers in each case, but we need to ensure we don't double-count numbers that might fit into more than one category.

So, the question is: \"If a car travels at a speed of 60 km/h for 2 hours and 30 minutes, what distance does it cover?\" Hmm, seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I do this right.\n\nFirst, I remember that the formula for distance is speed multiplied by time. So, distance = speed × time. The speed here is 60 km/h, and the time is 2 hours and 30 minutes. Wait, the time isn't in whole hours, so I need to convert that 30 minutes into hours to make the units match.\n\nRight, because the speed is in km per hour, the time should also be in hours. So 30 minutes is half an hour, which is 0.5 hours. So 2 hours and 30 minutes is the same as 2.5 hours. That makes the calculation easier.\n\nNow, plugging the numbers into the formula: 60 km/h multiplied by 2.5 hours. Let me do that multiplication. 60 times 2 is 120, and 60 times 0.5 is 30. So adding those together, 120 + 30 equals 150. So the distance covered should be 150 kilometers.\n\nWait, but let me check again. Maybe I should convert the time into fractional form instead of decimal to see if I get the same result. 30 minutes is 30/60 hours, which is 0.5, so 2 + 0.5 = 2.5 hours. So 60 × 2.5 is indeed 150. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of 2 hours and 30 minutes as 150 minutes total. But converting that to hours would be 150/60 = 2.5 hours again. So the same result. So regardless of how I convert the time, it's 2.5 hours. Multiplying by 60 km/h gives 150 km. \n\nI don't think there's any trick here. The problem is straightforward unit conversion and applying the formula. Maybe the confusion could come if someone forgets to convert minutes to hours, but since I did that, it should be correct.

The problem is about a car accelerating from 0 to 60 mph in 5 seconds. Then it continues at that speed for another 4 seconds. The question is, how much distance does it cover in total?

But the distance will be the sum of the distance covered during acceleration and the distance during constant speed.\n\nFor the acceleration part, the car starts at 0 and goes to 60 mph in 5 seconds. Wait, but I should probably convert everything into consistent units. Since the answer is in miles, maybe convert mph to something per second? Or maybe convert to feet and seconds because mph is miles per hour. Let me think. 60 mph is how many feet per second? Let me recall that 1 mile is 5280 feet and 1 hour is 3600 seconds. So 60 mph would be 60 * 5280 / 3600 feet per second. Let me calculate that. 60 divided by 3600 is 1/60, so 5280/60 is 88. So 60 mph is 88 feet per second.

Each orbital can hold a maximum of 2 electrons. To find the total number of orbitals, I need to determine how many electrons are in each shell and then how many orbitals are present in each subshell.\n\nThe shells are filled according to the Aufbau principle, and each subshell (s, p, d, f) has a certain number of orbitals.

Even numbers are those divisible by 2, right? So they would be 2, 4, 6, ..., 50.\n\nNow, to find the sum of these numbers. I remember there's a formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. Let me recall. The formula is (number of terms) multiplied by (first term plus last term) divided by 2. So, Sum = n/2 * (a₁ + aₙ), where n is the number of terms, a₁ is the first term, and aₙ is the last term.\n\nFirst, I need to determine how many terms there are. Since these are even numbers from 2 to 50, the number of terms can be calculated by taking the last term, dividing by 2. Because 2 is 2×1, 4 is 2×2, ..., 50 is 2×25. So the number of terms is 25.

Let's compute 25*52 first. 25 times 50 is 1250, and 25 times 2 is 50, so total is 1250 +50=1300. Then divide by 2: 1300/2=650. So the sum should be 650.\n\nWait, let me verify this another way.

Maybe \"coins\" here refers to something else, like \"outcomes\" or \"results\"? Because in probability, when you roll dice, each die has outcomes, not coins.

Because 6 is larger than 5. If the sum is 5, each die can be at most 5, right? Because if one die is 6, the other would have to be negative to make the sum 5, which isn't possible. So actually, if the sum is 5, neither die can be a 6. So the probability would be zero. That seems too straightforward. Maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, let me check again.

So, the question is about a square with side length 2, and there's a quarter-circle with radius 1 centered at each corner. The area of their intersection is shaded. Hmm, I need to find that shaded area.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the square. Each side is 2 units long. At each corner, there's a quarter-circle. Since the radius is 1, each quarter-circle would be in one corner, right? So, like, each quarter-circle would span from the corner to the midpoints of the adjacent sides because the radius is half the side length. Wait, the side length is 2, so radius 1 means each quarter-circle would just reach the middle of the sides. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the intersection area is where these quarter-circles overlap. Since there are four quarter-circles, each in a corner, their overlapping regions might form a sort of lens shape in the center of the square. But maybe there are multiple overlapping regions? Wait, actually, if each quarter-circle is in a corner, the overlapping area would be where all four circles intersect? No, that might not be possible. Wait, each quarter-circle is in a separate corner, so maybe the overlapping areas are between adjacent quarter-circles?

The quarter-circle there would be in the top-right corner, covering a quarter-circle of radius 1.

Similarly for the other corners.\n\nNow, the intersection of two adjacent quarter-circles would be where their areas overlap. For example, the quarter-circle at the top-right and the one at the top-left. Wait, no, those are diagonal from each other. Wait, actually, adjacent corners are connected by edges.

Wait, no, the square has four corners: let's say top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left. So adjacent corners are connected by edges.

The problem says \"at least 2 boys and at least 1 girl.\" So, that means the valid committees can have either 2 boys and 2 girls, 3 boys and 1 girl, or 4 boys and 0 girls, but wait, 4 boys would mean 0 girls, which violates the \"at least 1 girl\" condition.

Committees with 3 boys and 1 girl:\n   - Choose 3 boys out of 6: C(6,3)\n   - Choose 1 girl out of 4: C(4,1)\n   - Multiply these two.\n\nAdding both results will give the total number of valid committees.\n\nLet me compute each part step by step.\n\nFirst, C(6,2) is calculated as 6! / (2! * (6-2)!) = (6*5)/(2*1) = 15.\nC(4,2) is 4! / (2! * 2!) = (4*3)/(2*1) = 6.\nSo 15 * 6 = 90 for the 2B2G case.\n\nNext, C(6,3) is 6! / (3! * 3!) = (6*5*4)/(3*2*1) = 20.\nC(4,1) is 4.\nSo 20 * 4 = 80 for the 3B1G case.\n\nAdding them together: 90 +\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's try to figure out this problem. So, the question is about a square with side length 2, and there's a quarter-circle with radius 1 centered at each corner. The area of their intersection is shaded. Hmm, I need to find that shaded area.\n\nFirst, let me visualize the square. Each side is 2 units long. At each corner, there's a quarter-circle. Since the radius is 1, each quarter-circle would be in one corner, right? So, like, each quarter-circle would span from the corner to the midpoints of the adjacent sides because the radius is half the side length. Wait, the side length is 2, so radius 1 means each quarter-circle would just reach the middle of the sides. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the intersection area is where these quarter-circles overlap. Since there are four quarter-circles, each in a corner, their overlapping regions might form a sort of lens shape in the center of the square. But maybe there are multiple overlapping regions? Wait, actually, if each quarter-circle is in a corner, the overlapping area would be where all four circles intersect? No, that might not be possible. Wait, each quarter-circle is in a separate corner, so maybe the overlapping areas are between adjacent quarter-circles? Or maybe the intersection is between two adjacent quarter-circles?\n\nWait, maybe I should sketch this mentally. Let's take the top-right corner of the square. The quarter-circle there would be in the top-right corner, covering a quarter-circle of radius 1. Similarly, the quarter-circle at the top-left corner would be in the top-left, covering from the top-left corner to the midpoint of the top side and the midpoint of the left side. Similarly for the other corners.\n\nNow, the intersection of two adjacent quarter-circles would be where their areas overlap. For example, the quarter-circle at the top-right and the one at the top-left. Wait, no, those are diagonal from each other. Wait, actually, adjacent corners are connected by edges. So, the quarter-circle at the top-right corner and the one at the top-left corner are actually diagonally opposite? Wait, no, the square has four corners: let's say top-left, top-right, bottom-right, bottom-left. So adjacent corners are connected by edges. So, the quarter-circles at adjacent corners would be in adjacent corners, but their quarter-circles would be in adjacent corners.

Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that each of them divides into without leaving a remainder. So, to find the LCM of 3, 4, 5, and 6, I should probably break each number down into its prime factors and then take the highest power of each prime that appears.\n\nLet's list the prime factors of each number:\n\n- 3 is a prime number, so its prime factorization is just 3.\n- 4 can be broken down into 2 × 2, which is 2².\n- 5 is also a prime number, so it's just 5.\n- 6 is 2 × 3.\n\nNow, for each prime number that appears in these factorizations—2, 3, and 5—I need to take the highest power of each.\n\nLooking at 2: the exponents are 2 (from 4) and 1 (from 3 and 6).

So, the question is: \"What is the square root of 2 plus the cube root of 4?\" And I need to find the numerical value of that expression. Alright, let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that square roots and cube roots can sometimes be tricky, but maybe I can approximate them. Let's start with the square root of 2. I know that the square root of 2 is approximately 1.4142. I've seen that value before used in various calculations, so that seems right. Let me write that down: √2 ≈ 1.4142.\n\nNext up is the cube root of 4. Hmm, cube roots are a bit less common in everyday use. The cube root of 4 means a number that, when multiplied by itself three times, gives 4. Let me think. I know that 1 cubed is 1, 2 cubed is 8. So the cube root of 4 must be between 1 and 2. To get a better approximation, maybe I can use logarithms or remember some key values. Alternatively, I can use the fact that 4 is 2 squared, so the cube root of 4 is 2^(2/3). Wait, 2/3 is approximately 0.6667. So 2^0.6667. I know that 2^(1/3) is approximately 1.26, and 2^(2/3) would be (2^(1/3))^2. Let me calculate that. 1.26 squared is about 1.5874. But wait, that's 2^(2/3), which is the cube root of 4. So cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874. Let me check that again. If I cube 1.5874, does it equal 4? Let's see: 1.5874 * 1.5874 = approx 2.52, then 2.52 * 1.5874 ≈ 4.007. Oh, that's very close. So cube root of 4 is approximately 1.5874. Good.\n\nNow, I need to add these two values together: 1.4142 + 1.5874. Let's do the addition. Adding the decimal parts first: 0.4142 + 0.5874. That gives 1","full_output":"<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to check each option against all the given constraints. Let's go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant.\n\nFirst constraint: pharmacy must be at one end, and the other restaurant at the other end. Here, pharmacy is in position 1, and the other restaurant is in 7. That checks out.\n\nSecond constraint: the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The restaurants are in positions 4 and 7. The distance between them is 7 - 4 - 1 = 2. Wait, positions 4 and 7 are separated by positions 5, 6, and 7? Wait, no. If the first restaurant is in 4 and the second in 7, the number of spaces between them is 7 - 4 - 1 = 2. So there are two businesses (positions 5 and 6) between them. That's exactly two, which satisfies the \"at least two\" requirement. So that's okay.\n\nNext, the pharmacy must be next to optometrist or veterinarian. The pharmacy is in 1, adjacent to 2 (optometrist). That works.\n\nNow, check the toy store. It's in position 6. The adjacent positions are 5 (veterinarian) and 7 (restaurant). So the toy store is next to veterinarian. But the fifth constraint says the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. So this violates the constraint. Therefore, Option A is invalid.\n\nMoving to Option B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant.\n\nPharmacy is in 1, other restaurant in 7. That's good. Restaurants at 5 and 7. Separation: 7-5-1 = 1. Wait, positions 5 and 7: between them are positions 6. So only one business (position 6) between them. That's only one, which is less than the required two. So this violates the second constraint. Therefore, Option B is invalid.\n\nWait, the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. If they are in positions 5 and 7, the distance is 2 (positions 5,6,7). Wait, no. The number of spaces between them is 7 -5 -1 =1. So\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. Hmm, the question is about calculating the standard enthalpy change for the reaction where calcium carbonate decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. The given data includes the standard enthalpy of formation for CaCO3, CaO, and CO2. Alright, so I need to remember how to calculate the enthalpy change for a reaction using the standard enthalpies of formation.\n\nFirst, I recall that the standard enthalpy change of a reaction (ΔH°rxn) is calculated by subtracting the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the reactants multiplied by their stoichiometric coefficients from the sum of the enthalpies of formation of the products multiplied by their coefficients. The formula is ΔH°rxn = ΣΔHf°(products) - ΣΔHf°(reactants).\n\nThe reaction here is CaCO3(s) → CaO(s) + CO2(g). So, the reactant is calcium carbonate, and the products are calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. The standard enthalpy of formation values given are: CaCO3 is -1207 kJ/mol, CaO is -635.5 kJ/mol, and CO2 is -393.5 kJ/mol.\n\nWait, so applying the formula: the sum of the products would be ΔHf° for CaO plus ΔHf° for CO2. That would be (-635.5) + (-393.5). Then subtract the sum of the reactants, which is just ΔHf° for CaCO3, so -1207. Let me compute that.\n\nCalculating the products first: -635.5 + (-393.5) = -635.5 - 393.5 = -1029 kJ/mol. Then subtract the reactant: -1029 - (-1207) = -1029 + 1207 = 178 kJ/mol. Wait, but enthalpy changes for reactions can be positive or negative. A positive value here would mean the reaction is endothermic, but calcium carbonate decomposition is known to be endothermic, right? Because when you heat calcium carbonate, like in limestone, it decomposes into calcium oxide and carbon dioxide, which requires heat. So a positive ΔH°rxn makes sense here.\n\nBut let me double-check the arithmetic. Let's see: -635.5 minus 393.5 is indeed -1029. Then subtracting -1207\n\n<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem.

So, the question is: \"What is the sum of all numbers between 1 and 100 that are divisible by either 3 or 5?\" Alright, I need to find all numbers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3 or 5 and then add them up. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that when a problem asks for numbers divisible by either one thing or another, inclusion-exclusion principle comes into play. That means I should find the sum of numbers divisible by 3, add the sum of numbers divisible by 5, and then subtract the sum of numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 to avoid double-counting. Right, because some numbers are divisible by both, like 15, 30, etc., and they would be included in both sums if I just add them directly.\n\nSo, let's break it down. First, find all numbers between 1 and 100 divisible by 3. How do I do that? Well, the numbers divisible by 3 are 3, 6, 9, ..., up to the largest number less than or equal to 100. What's the last term here? Let's see, 3*33=99, so the numbers go up to 99. So there are 33 terms here (since 99/3=33). \n\nNow, to find the sum of an arithmetic series, the formula is (n/2)*(first term + last term). So for numbers divisible by 3: n=33, first term 3, last term 99. Sum is (33/2)*(3 + 99) = 16.5 * 102 = Let me compute that. 16*102=1632, 0.5*102=51, so total 1632+51=1683. Okay, so sum of multiples of 3 is 1683.\n\nNext, numbers divisible by 5. Similarly, they are 5, 10, 15, ..., up to 100. The last term is 100. How many terms? 100/5=20, so 20 terms. Applying the same formula: (20/2)*(5 + 100) = 10*105=1050. So sum of multiples of 5 is 1050.\n\nNow, the overlap: numbers divisible by both 3 and 5.

Hmm, let me think. I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principle from math class. Let me try to recall.\n\nFirst, if I want to find numbers divisible by 3 or 7, I can't just add the numbers divisible by 3 and those divisible by 7 because some numbers are divisible by both, like 21, 42, etc. So adding them directly would count those duplicates twice. That's where inclusion-exclusion comes in. So the formula should be: Number divisible by 3 + Number divisible by 7 - Number divisible by both 3 and 7. That way, we subtract the overlap that was double-counted.\n\nAlright, so let's break it down step by step. \n\nFirst, find how many numbers between 1 and 1000 are divisible by 3. To do that, I can divide 1000 by 3 and take the floor of the result. So 1000 ÷ 3 is approximately 333.333... So the integer part is 333.

So, we have three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest. Each of them has two targets: one for website requests and one for voicemail. The targets are either 1, 2, or 3 days. \n\nThe conditions given are:\n\n1. For each client, the website target is shorter than the voicemail target. So, website target < voicemail target for each client.\n2. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than their voicemail target. Wait, that's the same as the first condition. So maybe it's redundant. So each client's website is less than voicemail.\n3. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. So Image's voicemail is less than both Solide's and Truvest's voicemail.\n4. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. So Solide_web < Truvest_web.\n\nNow, the question states that Image's website target is 2 days. We need to find which of the options must also be 2 days.\n\nLet me start by setting up variables. Let's denote:\n\nFor each client, Website target = W, Voicemail target = V.\n\nGiven that Image's W is 2. So, Image's W=2. Then, since W < V, Image's V must be 3, because the possible targets are 1, 2, 3. So Image's V=3.\n\nNow, condition 3 says Image's voicemail (which is 3) must be shorter than the other clients' voicemails. Wait, shorter than Solide's V and Truvest's V. But the targets are in days, so a shorter target means fewer days. Wait, the problem says \"shorter than\", but in terms of days, 1 day is shorter than 2, which is shorter than 3. Wait, maybe there's confusion here. Wait, the problem says \"shorter than\", but in terms of days. So if a target is 1 day, it's shorter (takes less time) than 2 days, which is shorter than 3 days. So Image's voicemail target is 3 days, which is the longest. But the condition says Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Wait, that can't be possible because 3 is the maximum. Wait, this seems contradictory. Wait, perhaps the problem uses \"shorter than\"\n\n<think>\nOkay, let's see.

Since both are solid, they each are single colors. The rules about other colors being required don't apply here. But wait, rule 2 says if olive is used, peach must be used.

But the question specifies \"but not by both,\" so after finding the total for either, I need to subtract those that are divisible by both again. Wait, no.

The question is about determining which of the options could be true given certain conditions about the recruitment order of accomplices. Let's break down each condition and see how they interact.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the given information:\n\n1. The accomplices are recruited one at a time in some order.\n2. Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.\n3. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.\n4. Villas was recruited immediately before White.\n5. Peters was recruited fourth.\n\nAdditionally, we're told that Tao was recruited second. We need to see which of the options A-E must be true under this scenario.\n\nLet's start by noting the fixed position: Peters is fourth. So position 4 is Peters. Tao is second. So position 2 is Tao.\n\nNow, let's process the other conditions. Villas is immediately before White, so wherever Villas is, White is right after. So their positions must be consecutive with Villas first. Possible pairs could be (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), (4,5), (5,6). But position 2 is already taken by Tao, so (2,3) is possible for Villas and White. But wait, position 2 is Tao, so Villas can't be there. So possible Villas-White pairs are (1,2) but 2 is Tao, so no. Next is (3,4), but 4 is Peters. Then (4,5) but 4 is Peters. Then (5,6). So Villas must be in position 5 and White in 6. Wait, but wait: if Peters is in 4, then positions 5 and 6 are left. So Villas and White must be in 5 and 6, with Villas first. So that's a fixed point: position 5 is Villas, position 6 is White. So that's a pair that's fixed. So that's one thing.\n\nNext, Quinn is before Rovero. So wherever Quinn is, Rovero must be after him. The possible positions for Quinn and Rovero depend on other constraints.\n\nStanton cannot be adjacent to Tao. Since Tao is in position 2, Stanton can't be in 1 or 3. So Stanton must be in positions 4,5,6. But position 4 is Peters, 5 is Villas, 6 is White. So Stanton can't be in those. Therefore, Stanton must be in position 7? Wait, but\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: \"If a car travels at a speed of 60 km/h for 2 hours and 30 minutes, how far does it travel?\" Hmm, right, this is a distance problem. Distance is speed multiplied by time, so the formula should be distance = speed × time.\n\nFirst, let me make sure I understand the units. The speed is given in kilometers per hour, and the time is 2 hours and 30 minutes. Oh, right, the time has hours and minutes. I need to convert the 30 minutes into hours to keep the units consistent. Because the speed is km per hour, the time should be in hours.\n\nSo, 30 minutes is half an hour, right? Because 60 minutes make an hour. So 30 minutes is 0.5 hours. That means the total time is 2 hours plus 0.5 hours, which equals 2.5 hours. Got that part down.\n\nNow, plugging the numbers into the formula. The speed is 60 km/h, and the time is 2.5 hours. So multiplying them together: 60 × 2.5. Let me do that calculation. 60 times 2 is 120, and 60 times 0.5 is 30. Adding those together, 120 + 30 equals 150. So the car travels 150 kilometers. \n\nWait, let me double-check. Alternatively, 2.5 hours can be written as 5/2 hours. So 60 multiplied by 5/2 is (60 × 5)/2 = 300/2 = 150. Yep, same result. That seems right. \n\nIs there another way to verify? Maybe break down the time. In 1 hour, the car goes 60 km. So in 2 hours, it's 120 km. Then in 30 minutes, which is half an hour, it would go half the distance of 60 km, which is 30 km. Adding those, 120 + 30 = 150 km. All methods lead to 150. Okay, confident that's the correct answer.\n\n</think>\n\nThe car travels at 60 km/h for 2.5 hours.  \n**Distance** = Speed × Time = 60 × 2.5 = **150 km**.  \n\n**Final answer:**  \n\\boxed{150}<think>\nOkay, let's see.

It's a bit complex with several constraints, so I need to break it down step by step. First, I need to understand the setup and all the conditions given. The question is about selecting photographs for three newspaper sections (Lifestyle, Metro, Sports) with specific conditions related to photographers and their assignments. The main question is: if both photographs in one section are by Gagnon, which of the options A-E could be true.\n\nLet me start by listing all the given constraints to make sure I don't miss any:\n\n1. Each section (Lifestyle, Metro, Sports) has exactly two photographs, no repeats.\n2. Each photograph is taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes (F), Gagnon (G), Hue (H).\n3. For each photographer, at least one but no more than three photographs must appear in total. Wait, but since there are six photographs total (two per section, three sections), each photographer can have 1, 2, or 3 photos. But the constraint says \"at least one but no more than three\" for each. However, since there are three photographers and six photos, each would have exactly two photos on average, but the constraints allow up to three. So each photographer must have between 1 and 3 photos, inclusive. So no photographer can have zero or four or five photos. But since the total is six, and each has at least 1, the possible distributions are permutations where each has at least 1 and at most 3. For example, 3,1,2 or 2,2,2. But the exact distribution isn't specified here; this is part of the problem's constraints.\n\nNext, there are several specific conditions:\n\n- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. So, if someone has a photo in Lifestyle, there must be another photo in that same photographer in Metro. Or maybe not necessarily the same photographer? Wait, the wording is \"at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.\" So, there exists at least one photographer such that they have a photo in both Lifestyle and Metro.

There are five students—Grecia, Hakeem, Joe, Katya, and Louise—each working two shifts over five days (Monday to Friday). Each shift (first and second) per day is assigned to one student, and no student works both shifts on the same day. We have several constraints to consider.\n\nFirst, let's list out all the constraints again to make sure I don't miss any:\n\n1. Louise works the second shift on two consecutive days.\n2. Grecia works the first shift on two non-consecutive days.\n3. Katya works on Tuesday and Friday. So Katya has shifts on those days, but each day has two shifts, so she can be in either first or second on each of those days.\n4. Hakeem and Joe work together at least once.\n5. Grecia and Louise never work together on the same day.\n\nThe question asks which of the options A-E must be true. Let's go through each option and see if we can find a contradiction or if it's necessarily true.\n\nStarting with Option A: Grecia does not work on Tuesday.\n\nTo check this, we need to see if there's a possible schedule where Grecia does work on Tuesday, or if it's impossible. Let's try to construct a possible schedule.\n\nFirst, Katya is on Tuesday and Friday. Let's assign her shifts. Suppose Katya works the first shift on Tuesday and the second shift on Friday. Then, Tuesday's first shift is Katya, and Friday's second shift is Katya. Alternatively, Katya could be on the second shift on Tuesday and first on Friday. Let's try one scenario.\n\nNow, Louise needs to be in the second shift on two consecutive days. Let's say she does that on Monday and Tuesday. So Monday's second shift is Louise, and Tuesday's second shift is Katya (as per Katya's assignment). Wait, but if Tuesday's second shift is Katya, then Louise can't be on Tuesday. So maybe Louise's consecutive days are Wednesday and Thursday. Let's try that. So Wednesday's second shift is Louise, and Thursday's second shift is Louise. That uses two consecutive days for Louise.\n\nGrecia needs to be in the first shift on two non-consecutive days. Let's assign her to first shifts on Monday and Thursday. So Monday's first shift is Grecia, and Thursday's first shift is Grecia. Then, the other shifts for Grecia would be on those days.

So, we need to figure out which of the options A to E must be true based on the given conditions. Let me start by listing out all the constraints again to make sure I have them straight.\n\nFirst, the sundial can't be on June 1st. Got that. Then, there's a conditional statement: If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror must also be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. So, harmonica < lamp implies mirror < lamp. But if the harmonica is not before the lamp, then that condition doesn't apply. \n\nNext, the sundial must be before both the mirror and the vase. So, sundial < mirror and sundial < vase. That's two separate inequalities. \n\nThen, the table has to be either before the harmonica or before the vase, but not both. So, table < harmonica XOR table < vase. Wait, the wording says \"either ... or ... but not both.\" Hmm. So that means the table is either before the harmonica and not before the vase, or before the vase and not before the harmonica. So it's an exclusive OR. So table < harmonica → table must be > vase. Or table < vase → table must be > harmonica. \n\nAlright, now let's look at each option and see if they can fit into the schedule without violating any conditions. Let's start with option B, since the hint mentions that, but maybe I should check all first.\n\nOption B: Sundial on June 2nd, vase on June 3rd. So, sundial is 2nd, vase 3rd. Then, according to the sundial condition, sundial must be before mirror and vase. So mirror must be after sundial (3rd or later). But vase is on 3rd, so mirror must be on 4th, 5th, or 6th. Let's see. Also, the harmonica and lamp's positions. The lamp's position isn't specified here except that the table is not mentioned. Wait, in option B, the only info given is sundial on 2nd and vase on 3rd. The other items (harmonica, lamp, table, mirror) need to be placed in the remaining days: 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th. But wait, the sundial is on 2nd, so harmon\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many integers between 1 and 1000 are divisible by 6 but not by 8. Let me start by understanding the problem. The question is asking for the count of numbers in that range that are divisible by 6 but exclude those that are also divisible by 8. \n\nFirst, I should find how many numbers between 1 and 1000 are divisible by 6. Then, subtract the numbers that are divisible by both 6 and 8 because those would be the ones we need to exclude. That makes sense because if a number is divisible by both 6 and 8, it's divisible by their least common multiple (LCM). So, I need to calculate the LCM of 6 and 8 first.\n\nLet me recall how to find the LCM. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. To compute it, I can use the formula: LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b). The GCD is the greatest common divisor. \n\nSo, for 6 and 8, the GCD is 2 because 6 factors into 2*3 and 8 into 2^3. The common factor is 2. Therefore, LCM(6,8) = (6*8)/2 = 48/2 = 24. Wait, no, 6*8 is 48, divided by 2 is 24. Right. So the LCM is 24. That means numbers divisible by both 6 and 8 are the numbers divisible by 24.\n\nTherefore, the count of numbers divisible by 6 but not by 8 is equal to the count of numbers divisible by 6 minus the count of numbers divisible by 24.\n\nNow, let's compute each count. \n\nFirst, numbers divisible by 6 between 1 and 1000. The formula for the number of multiples of a number n up to x is floor(x/n). So here, it's floor(1000/6). Let me calculate that. 1000 divided by 6 is approximately 166.666..., so the floor is 166. So there are 166 numbers between 1 and 1000 divisible by 6.\n\nNext, numbers divisible by 24. Using the same formula: floor(1000/24). 1000 divided by 24 is about 41.666..., so the floor\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, so I have this problem here: \"Now return ONLY single final answer to the question inside <ans>.\" Hmm, let's try to figure out what exactly is being asked.

I remember that when you need to find a common multiple of numbers, especially the least one, it's about finding the least common multiple or LCM. Let me recall how that works.\n\nFirst, maybe I should break each number down into its prime factors. Let's see. 7 is a prime number, so its prime factor is just 7. 8 can be broken down into 2 × 2 × 2, which is 2³. And 9 is 3 × 3, so that's 3². \n\nNow, the LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes that appear in the factorizations. So for the primes involved here: 2, 3, and 7.

We need to select 2 from each group and find the probability that the number of girls selected from Group A equals that from Group B.\n\nFirst, I should figure out the total number of ways to choose 2 students from each group. For Group A, that's combination of 5 choose 2, which is 10. For Group B, it's 4 choose 2, which is 6. So the total number of possible selections is 10 * 6 = 60. That will be the denominator of our probability.\n\nNow, the numerator is the number of favorable outcomes where the number of girls selected from A equals that from B. Let's consider all possible cases where this can happen:\n\nCase 1: Both groups select 0 girls. So, from Group A, we pick 2 boys, and from Group B, 2 boys. Let's calculate that. Group A has 2 boys, so choosing 2 is 1 way. Group B has 2 boys, choosing 2 is also 1 way. So 1 * 1 = 1 combination here.\n\nCase 2: Both groups select 1 girl each. For Group A, choosing 1 girl out of 3 and 1 boy out of 2. That's C(3,1)*C(2,1) = 3*2=6. For Group B, choosing 1 girl out of 2 and 1 boy out of 2. That's C(2,1)*C(2,1)=2*2=4.

The question is about arranging seven clues (R, S, T, U, W, X, Z) in chapters 1 through 7 with certain constraints. The key point is that Z is in chapter 7, and we need to determine which of the options A to E must be true under this condition.\n\nFirst, let's list all the constraints again to make sure I don't miss any:\n\n1. T cannot be in chapter 1.\n2. T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating them. So if T is in chapter n, W must be in chapter n+3. For example, T in 2 → W in 5, T in 3 → W in 6, T in 4 → W in 7. But since Z is in 7, W can't be there. So possible T and W positions are T in 2 → W in 5, T in 3 → W in 6.\n3. S and Z cannot be adjacent. Since Z is in 7, S can't be in 6.\n4. W and X cannot be adjacent.\n5. U and X must be adjacent.\n6. All clues are used exactly once.\n\nGiven that Z is in chapter 7, let's note that. So chapter 7 is Z. Then S can't be in 6. Let's consider possible T and W positions.\n\nPossible T positions are 2,3,4 (since T can't be 1, and if T is 4, W would be 7, which is Z. So that's invalid. So T can only be in 2 or 3. If T is in 2, W is in 5. If T is in 3, W is in 6. Let's explore both possibilities.\n\nFirst scenario: T in 2, W in 5.\n\nNow, Z is in 7. Let's check constraints:\n\n- S cannot be in 6 (since Z is 7, S can't be 6).\n- W (5) and X cannot be adjacent. So X can't be in 4 or 6. Also, U and X must be adjacent.

The question is asking for the number of integers between 1 and 1000 inclusive that are divisible by either 3 or 5 but not both. Hmm, right. So I need to find numbers divisible by 3 or 5, but exclude those divisible by both. \n\nFirst, I remember that to find the count of numbers divisible by either of two numbers, we can use the inclusion-exclusion principle. The formula is usually the number divisible by A plus the number divisible by B minus the number divisible by both A and B. That way, we avoid double-counting the ones divisible by both. But in this case, we need to exclude those divisible by both. Wait, the problem says \"but not both,\" so actually, we want numbers divisible by 3 or 5, but not their intersection. So that would be (numbers divisible by 3 + numbers divisible by 5 - 2*numbers divisible by both). Because normally inclusion-exclusion subtracts once the overlap, but here we need to subtract it twice to exclude it entirely. Let me check that again.\n\nLet me think. If I have A as numbers divisible by 3, B as numbers divisible by 5. Then the count for A union B is |A| + |B| - |A∩B|. But if we want to exclude the intersection, then it's |A| + |B| - 2|A∩B|. Because originally, the union includes A and B but subtracts the overlap once. If we want to exclude the overlap entirely, we need to subtract it twice: once to remove it from A and once from B. So yes, the formula should be |A| + |B| - 2|A∩B|.\n\nSo first, calculate how many numbers between 1 and 1000 are divisible by 3. That's the floor division of 1000 by 3. Let's compute 1000 ÷ 3. 3*333=999, so 333 numbers. Then divisible by 5: 1000 ÷5 is 200, so 200 numbers. Now the intersection, numbers divisible by both 3 and 5, which is divisible by 15. 1000 ÷15 is 66.666..., so floor that to 66. So 66 numbers.\n\nPutting it all together: 333 + 200 - 2*66 = 333 +\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's see.

But mc squared gives energy in what's called joules when using kilograms for mass? Let me confirm. Yes, 1 joule is the work done when applying a force of 1 newton over 1 meter. And the standard equation here is E = mc², where c is the speed of light.\n\nWait, the speed of light is approximately 3×10^8 meters per second. So I need to square that.

Each clue is mentioned exactly once. There are several constraints to consider.\n\nFirst, let me list out all the constraints again to make sure I don't miss any:\n\n1. T cannot be in chapter 1.\n2. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating them. So if T is in chapter n, W has to be in chapter n + 3. For example, if T is in 2, W must be in 5. But since there are only 7 chapters, n + 3 ≤7 → n ≤4. So possible T positions are 2,3,4, and W would be 5,6,7 respectively.\n3. S and Z cannot be in adjacent chapters.\n4. W and X cannot be in adjacent chapters.\n5. U and X must be in adjacent chapters.\n6. The options given (A-E) are possible truths, and we need to determine which one must be true based on the constraints.\n\nThe question asks which of the options could be true, so we need to check each one against the constraints and see if there's at least one possible arrangement that satisfies all the constraints while making that option true. However, the options are presented as possibilities, so the correct answer is the one that must be true in all valid arrangements, or at least possible in some valid arrangement.\n\nLet me go through each option:\n\nOption A: R is mentioned in chapter 7. So we need to check if R can be in chapter 7. Let's see if there's a possible arrangement where R is in 7. Let's try to construct such a scenario.\n\nFirst, let's handle the T and W constraint. Let's choose T in chapter 4. Then W would be in 7 (4+3=7). Then, U and X must be adjacent. Let's place X and U next. Suppose X is in 5 and U in 6. Then chapters left are 1,2,3. Let's place S and Z such that they are not adjacent. Let's put S in 2 and Z in 3. Then the remaining clues are R and... wait, all clues are R, S, T, U, W, X, Z. Wait, T is 4, W is7, X is5, U is6.\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this problem. So, the question is about a person who is 3 times as old as their child. In 12 years, the person will be twice as old as the child. I need to find their current ages. Hmm, age problems can be tricky, but let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me define variables for their current ages. Let's say the child's current age is C years. Then the person's age would be 3C because they are three times as old. That part seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the second part of the problem says that in 12 years, the person's age will be twice the child's age at that time. So, in 12 years, the child's age will be C + 12, and the person's age will be 3C + 12. According to the problem, at that future time, the person's age is twice the child's age. So, I can set up an equation: 3C + 12 = 2*(C + 12).\n\nLet me write that equation down clearly: 3C + 12 = 2(C + 12). Now, I need to solve for C. Expanding the right side first: 2*C is 2C, and 2*12 is 24. So the equation becomes 3C + 12 = 2C + 24.\n\nNext, subtract 2C from both sides to get: 3C - 2C +12 = 24. That simplifies to C + 12 = 24. Then, subtract 12 from both sides: C = 24 - 12 = 12. Wait, so the child is 12 years old currently? Then the person is 3*12 = 36 years old.\n\nBut let me check if this makes sense. In 12 years, the child will be 12 + 12 = 24, and the person will be 36 + 12 = 48. Is 48 twice 24? Yes, because 24*2 is 48. That works out. So the current ages would be 36 and 12.\n\nWait, but let me double-check my equations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting again: current ages are 3C and C. In 12 years: 3C +12 and C +12. The equation is 3C +12 = 2*(C +12). Solving that: 3C\n\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about calculating the energy released when a certain mass is converted into energy, right? I remember from Einstein's equation E=mc². But wait, I need to make sure I get the units right and any conversion factors.\n\nSo, the mass given is 5 kilograms. The user wants the energy in joules. Alright, E equals mc squared. But mc squared gives energy in what's called joules when using kilograms for mass? Let me confirm. Yes, 1 joule is the work done when applying a force of 1 newton over 1 meter. And the standard equation here is E = mc², where c is the speed of light.\n\nWait, the speed of light is approximately 3×10^8 meters per second. So I need to square that. Let me compute that first. 3×10^8 m/s squared is 9×10^16 m²/s². Then multiply by the mass, which is 5 kg. So 5 kg times 9×10^16 m²/s². That would be 45×10^16 joules. But maybe I should express that in proper scientific notation. 45×10^16 is the same as 4.5×10^17 joules. Hmm, but wait, is there a mistake here? Let me check the calculation again.\n\nSpeed of light c = 3.0×10^8 m/s. Squared: (3.0×10^8)^2 = 9.0×10^16 m²/s². Multiply by 5 kg: 5 * 9.0×10^16 = 45×10^16. Converting to scientific notation, that's 4.5×10^17 joules. Yeah, that seems right. \n\nBut wait, sometimes people use the exact speed of light value. The precise value is 299,792,458 m/s, but using 3×10^8 is an approximation. However, since the problem doesn't specify using the exact value, maybe the approximation is acceptable here. Let me see. If I use the more precise c value, would the answer change significantly? Let's try. c squared is (299,792,458)^2. Let's approximate that as roughly (3×10^8)^2, which is 8.987×10^16 m²/s².
