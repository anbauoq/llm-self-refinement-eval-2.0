Hmm, let's see. I remember this might be a Fibonacci sequence problem. Let me think through it step by step.\n\nLet's start with smaller numbers to see if I can find a pattern. If there's 1 step, there's only one way: take a single step. For 2 steps, you could take two 1-steps or one 2-step, so that's 2 ways. What about 3 steps? Well, if I think about the last move, if I end on a 1-step, then before that I must have been at 2 steps. If I end on a 2-step, then I was at 1 step. So the total ways for 3 steps would be the sum of the ways for 2 and 1 steps, which is 2 + 1 = 3. \n\nWait, that does look like the Fibonacci sequence!

Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both. So exactly one of them must be assigned. If one is in, the other can't be.\n2. If Jaramillo is assigned, then Kayne must also be assigned.

Then, sum them up. \n\nWait, but how do I find the first multiple of 13 that's greater than or equal to 100? Maybe I can divide 100 by 13 and see what the quotient is. Let me calculate that. 13 times 7 is 91, which is less than 100. 13 times 8 is 104. So 104 is the first multiple of 13 after 100. Got that.\n\nThen, the last multiple of 13 before 1000. Let's divide 1000 by 13. Hmm, 13 times 76 is 988. 13 times 77 is 1001, which is over 1000.

Right, inclusion-exclusion principle says that |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|.\n\nAlright, so let's break it down. First, find how many numbers between 1 and 1000 are divisible by 6.

So, numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, etc. \n\nLet me list out all numbers from 1 to 10 and check which ones are prime. Starting with 1. Wait, is 1 a prime? Hmm, no. I remember that by definition, primes have to be greater than 1, so 1 is out.\n\nNext is 2. That's the first prime. It's only divisible by 1 and 2. So 2 is prime. Then 3. Similarly, divisible only by 1 and 3. Prime. 4... Let's see. 4 can be divided by 1, 2, and 4. So not prime. 5 is next. Divisible by 1 and 5. Prime. 6? Divisible by 2 and 3 as well.

The question is about calculating the standard enthalpy change for the dissolution of magnesium nitrate in water. The given data includes the lattice energy of magnesium nitrate as 79000 cal/mol and the hydration enthalpy for Mg²+ (aq) as -4640 cal/mol and for NO3⁻ (aq) as -4540 cal/mol. Alright, so I need to find ΔH_solution.\n\nHmm, I remember that the enthalpy change of solution can be estimated using the Born-Haber-like cycle for the dissolution process. The general idea is that the solution process involves breaking the ionic lattice (which requires energy, so positive) and then hydrating the ions (which releases energy, so negative). The overall enthalpy change is the sum of these steps.\n\nSo, magnesium nitrate is Mg(NO3)2. When it dissolves in water, the lattice breaks apart into Mg²+ and NO3⁻ ions. Since it's Mg(NO3)2, there are two nitrate ions per magnesium ion. Therefore, the dissolution reaction would be:\n\nMg(NO3)2(s) → Mg²+(aq) + 2 NO3⁻(aq)\n\nThe lattice energy (U) is the energy\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem.

So, the question is: \"If a car travels at a speed of 60 km/h for 2 hours and 30 minutes, how far does it travel in kilometers?\" Hmm, seems straightforward, but I want to make sure I do this right.\n\nFirst, I remember that distance is calculated by multiplying speed by time. The formula is distance = speed × time. So, the speed here is 60 km/h, and the time is 2 hours and 30 minutes. Wait, the time is given in hours and minutes, but the speed is per hour.

So, the question is about figuring out which pair of colors cannot be the solid rugs when there are exactly two solid rugs, given all those constraints. Let me break down the information first.\n\nFirst, there are six colors: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow. Exactly five of them are used in the rugs. Each used color is in only one rug. The rugs can be either solid (single color) or multicolored. The rules are:\n\n1. If a rug has white, it must have two other colors. So white can't be a solid rug because that would require three colors. So any white rug is multicolored with exactly three colors.\n\n2. If a rug has olive, then it must have peach. So olive can't be alone; if olive is used, peach must be in the same rug. So olive must be in a multicolored rug with peach and possibly others.\n\n3. Forest and turquoise can't be in the same rug. So if one is used, the other can't be in that rug.\n\n4. Peach and turquoise can't be together in a rug.\n\n5. Peach and yellow can't be together in a rug.\n\nNow, there are\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, so I need to solve this problem where I have to find the number of integers between 1 and 2020 inclusive that are divisible by 4 or 6. Hmm, let's see. I remember something about inclusion-exclusion principle from math class. Let me try to recall.\n\nFirst, if I want to find the count of numbers divisible by 4 or 6, I can't just add the numbers divisible by 4 and those by 6 because some numbers might be divisible by both, and I'd be counting them twice. So, I need to subtract the overlap. The formula should be: Number of multiples of 4 + Number of multiples of 6 - Number of multiples of both 4 and 6. Right, that makes sense.\n\nSo, let's break it down. The number of integers between 1 and 2020 divisible by 4 is floor(2020/4). Similarly for 6. Then, the least common multiple (LCM) of 4 and 6 is 12, so the numbers divisible by both are those divisible by 12. Therefore, subtract floor(2020/12).\n\nWait, let me compute each part step by step.

So, the question is: \"What is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by 7 and leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 5?\" Hmm, right. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find a number that satisfies two conditions. The first condition is that it must be divisible by 7. So, if the number is N, then N mod 7 equals 0. The second condition is that when N is divided by 5, the remainder is 4. So, N mod 5 equals 4. And we need the smallest positive such integer.\n\nLet me rephrase that. We need N such that:\n\n1. N ≡ 0 mod 7\n2. N ≡ 4 mod 5\n\nSo, this is a system of congruences. I remember that the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) is useful for solving such systems when the moduli are coprime. Since 7 and 5 are both prime and hence coprime, their greatest common divisor is 1.

The problem is about a car accelerating from rest at 5 m/s². We need to find the distance it travels during the 3rd second. Hmm. So, the car starts from rest, which means initial velocity u is 0. The acceleration a is 5 m/s². The time interval we're interested in is the 3rd second, which I think means between t=2s and t=3s. Right, because the first second is 0 to 1s, the second second is 1 to 2s, so the third would be 2 to 3s.\n\nTo find the distance covered during that specific second, maybe I should calculate the total distance at 3s and subtract the distance at 2s.

So, we have three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports. Each has two photos, and there are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.

But since there are only six photos total and three photographers, each must have exactly two photos. Wait, wait. Wait, the total is six photos. Three photographers, so 6/3=2 each. But the condition says at least one and no more than three. But 2 is within that range, so each photographer must have exactly two photos. Hmm, that's a key point.

The problem is about a car traveling from point A to point B. The total distance between A and B is 200 km. The car starts by traveling at a speed of 60 km/h for the first 80 km. Then it stops for a 30-minute break. After that, it continues the remaining journey at a speed of 80 km/h. The question is asking for the average speed of the entire journey from A to B.\n\nFirst, I need to remember that average speed is total distance divided by total time. So, I can't just take the average of the speeds; I have to calculate the total time taken for the trip and then use that to find the average speed.\n\nLet's break down the journey into parts. The first part is traveling 80 km at 60 km/h. To find the time taken for this part, I can use the formula time = distance/speed. So 80 divided by 60. That would be 1 hour and 20 minutes because 80/60 is 1.333... hours, which is 80 minutes. Wait, no, 60 km/h means 1 hour for 60 km, so 80 km would take 80/60 hours,\n\n<think>\nOkay, let's see.

That should give the distance covered just in the third second. Let me recall the equation for distance under constant acceleration. The formula is s = ut + 0.5 * a * t².

Let me label the square ABCD, with A at the bottom-left corner, B at the bottom-right, C at the top-right, and D at the top-left. So, AB is the bottom side, BC is the right side, CD is the top, and DA is the left side. Each side is length 2.\n\nPoint E is the midpoint of AB. Since AB is 2 units long, E would be at 1 unit from A and B. Similarly, F is the midpoint of CD, so 1 unit from C and D. So E is halfway along the bottom edge, and F halfway along the top edge.\n\nNow, G is where lines AF and EC cross each other. So AF is a line from A to F, and EC is a line from E to C.

The second car catches up with the first one at a point 30 km past the service station. We need to find the speed of the second car.\n\nHmm. Let's visualize this.

So, to find velocity, I need to integrate the acceleration function. Then, integrate velocity to get displacement. Let's start with that.\n\nThe acceleration function is a(t) = a0 - kt. Integrating this with respect to time should give velocity. The integral of a(t) dt is a0*t - (k/2)t² + C, where C is the constant of integration. Since the car starts from rest, the initial velocity at t=0 is zero. Plugging t=0 into the velocity equation gives 0 = a0*0 - (k/2)*0 + C, so C=0. Therefore, the velocity as a function of time is v(t) = a0*t - (k/2)t².\n\nNext, to find the displacement (distance traveled\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, let's see.

Let me write that out: x^(1/3) * x² + x^(1/3) * 1. Which is x^(7/3) + x^(1/3). So the integral becomes ∫x^(7/3) dx + ∫x^(1/3) dx. \n\nNow, integrating term by term. The integral of x^n dx is (x^(n+1))/(n+1) + C. So for the first term, n is 7/3. Adding 1 gives 10/3. So the first part is (x^(10/3))/(10/3) which simplifies to (3\n\n<think>\n\nOkay, so I have this problem here: \"Now return ONLY single final answer to the question inside <ans> </ans>.\" Hmm, let me try to figure out what this means.

The walls are numbered 1 through 4, each holding two paintings, one upper and one lower. The conditions are:\n\n1. No wall has only watercolors. So each wall must have at least one oil.\n2. No wall has work from only one student. So each wall must have two different students.\n3. No wall has both Franz's oil and Isaacs's oil. So on any wall, if there's Franz's oil, Isaacs can't have oil there.\n4. Greene's watercolor is upper on the same wall as Franz's oil.\n5. Isaacs's oil is lower on wall 4.\n\nThe options are A to E, each stating that two students' paintings are all in upper positions or all in lower positions.\n\nFirst, let's break down condition 4: Greene's watercolor is upper where Franz's oil is. So wherever Franz's oil is, Greene's watercolor is in the upper slot of that wall. Since each student has two paintings, Franz has an oil and a watercolor. So Franz's oil must be on a wall"}
