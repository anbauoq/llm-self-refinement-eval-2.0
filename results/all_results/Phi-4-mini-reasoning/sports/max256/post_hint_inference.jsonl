The question is whether \"Luis Suarez performed a give and go\" is plausible. First, I need to figure out who Luis Suarez is. He’s a professional soccer player, right? So he plays football (as many countries say soccer). Now, the \"give and go\" is a term I'm more familiar with from basketball. In basketball, a give and go is a quick pass between two players running parallel. But in soccer, they don't use that term. The correct terminology in soccer would be something like a \"give and take\" maybe, or a quick one-to-one. So if Suarez did something that's called a \"give and go\" in basketball, that's mixing the terms. Since the sentence uses the wrong term for soccer, the action might have happened, but the way it's phrased with the incorrect term makes the whole statement implausible.

The question is asking if it's plausible that Lamar Jackson hit the back shoulder fade. First, I need to figure out what each part means.\n\nLamar Jackson is a well-known NFL quarterback, right? So in American football, quarterbacks usually throw the ball rather than hit it. They use equipment like a football, not a hockey stick. The term \"fade\" in football usually refers to a passing move where the quarterback throws to a moving receiver in a diagonal direction. That's different from hockey, where a \"fade\" might mean a slight angle on a slap shot.\n\nSo the sentence mixes sports terminology here. \"Hit the back shoulder fade\" sounds like a hockey action because it mentions a stick (back shoulder) and fade, which is more common in hockey. But Lamar Jackson is an NFL quarterback, so he's associated with football, not hockey. Therefore, this scenario is inconsistent with real-world sports practices and equipment.

The problem is about calculating the total surface area of a cylinder, including the top and bottom circles. The cylinder has a height of 10 cm and a radius of 3 cm. Alright, so I need to remember the formulas for the surface areas of a cylinder.\n\nFirst, the surface area of a cylinder consists of two parts: the lateral surface area and the area of the two circular bases. So, the total surface area is the sum of these three parts. Wait, no, actually, the two circular bases are just the top and bottom, so each has an area of πr². Since there are two, that would be 2πr². Then the lateral surface area is the side part, which if you unroll it, becomes a rectangle. The height of that rectangle is the same as the cylinder's height, and the width is the circumference of the base circle. The circumference is 2πr. So the lateral surface area is 2πr multiplied by the height h. So that's 2πrh.\n\nSo adding those together, the total surface area should be 2πr² + 2πrh. Let me check that again.

There's a spring inside the box, which isn't attached to the wall. The spring has a constant of 50 N/m and is compressed by 0.02 meters. A 0.25 kg mass is inside the box, and when the spring is released, it pushes the mass until it hits the wall. The box is 1 meter long, and the wall is at the end. The question is, where does the mass hit the wall? Alright, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, since the surface is frictionless, the only force acting on the mass after the spring is released is the spring force. The spring isn't attached to the wall, so when it's compressed, it stores potential energy. When released, that potential energy is converted into the kinetic energy of the mass. But wait, the mass is inside the box, so once the spring pushes it, the mass will start moving towards the wall. But the box is also free to move because there's no friction.
