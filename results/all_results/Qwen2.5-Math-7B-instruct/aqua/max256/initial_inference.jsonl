Let's denote the monthly sales by \\( S \\).\n\nThe servant's total monthly income is given by the sum of his base salary and his commission. The base salary is 1500, and the commission is 15% of the monthly sales. Therefore, we can write the equation for the total monthly income as:\n\n\\[\n1500 + 0.15S = 6000\n\\]\n\nTo find \\( S \\), we first isolate the commission term by subtracting 1500 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[\n0.15S = 6000 - 1500\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\n\\[\n0.15S = 4500\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( S \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 0.15:\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{4500}{0.15}\n\\]\n\nTo simplify the division, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by\n\n<ans>30000</ans>)\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{A}\\).}","ground_truth":"A","predicted_answer":"A","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

Six pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as do two rolls. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   6P = 2R \\implies R = 3P\n   \\]\n2. Three rolls contain the same amount of falafel as five baguettes. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   3R = 5B \\implies B = \\frac{3R}{5}\n   \\]\n   Substituting \\( R = 3P \\) into the equation for \\( B \\), we get:\n   \\[\n   B = \\frac{3(3P)}{5} = \\frac{9P}{5}\n   \\]\n3. We need to find how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes\n\nTo find how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel as two baguettes, we start by determining the amount of falafel in two baguettes. Since each baguette contains \\(\\frac{9P}{5}\\) units of falafel, two baguettes contain:\n\\[\n2B = 2 \\left( \\frac{9P}{5} \\right) = \\frac{18P}{5}\n\\]\nThis means that two baguettes contain \\(\\frac{18P}{5}\\) units of falafel. We need to find out how many pita breads contain the same amount of falafel. Since each pita bread contains \\(P\\) units of falafel, the number of pita breads required to contain \\(\\frac{18P}{5}\\) units of falafel is:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\frac{18P}{5}}{P} = \\frac{18P}{5P} = \\frac{18}{5}\n\\]\nTherefore, two baguettes contain the same amount of falafel as \\(\\frac{18}{5}\\) pita breads.
