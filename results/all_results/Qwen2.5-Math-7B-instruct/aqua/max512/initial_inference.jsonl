Since \\(R + T = 2Q\\), it implies that R and T are symmetrically placed around Q. Therefore, the difference between R and Q's age is:\n     \\[\n     R - Q = Q - T = \\frac{R + T - 2T}{2} = \\frac{50 - 2T}{2}\n     \\]\n   - Since \\(R + T = 2Q\\), we can also express \\(T\\) as \\(T = 2Q - R\\).

The number of helpers required is 12. The calculation is as follows:\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of cakes each helper can produce in 3 hours and 20 minutes. Since 20 minutes is \\(\\frac{20}{60} = \\frac{1}{3}\\) of an hour, the total time available is \\(3 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{10}{3}\\) hours.\n\nIf a helper makes 2 large cakes per hour, then in \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\) hours, each helper can make:\n\\[2 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} \\text{ large cakes}\\]\n\nIf a helper makes 35 small cakes per hour, then in \\(\\frac{10}{3}\\) hours, each helper can make:\n\\[35 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{350}{3} \\text{ small cakes}\\]\n\nLet \\(x\\) be the number of helpers. The total number of large cakes produced by \\(x\\) helpers is:\n\\[x \\times \\frac{20}{3} = \\frac{20x}{3}\\]\n\nThe total number of small cakes produced by \\(x\\) helpers is:\n\\[x \\times \\frac{350}{3} = \\frac{350x}{3}\\]\n\nWe need to satisfy the requirement of 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes, so we set up the following system of equations:\n\\[\\frac{20x}{3} = 25\\]\n\\[\\frac{350x}{3} = 700\\]\n\nFirst, solve the equation for the large cakes:\n\\[\\frac{20x}{3} = 25\\]\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\\[20x = 75\\]\nDivide both sides by 20:\n\\[x = 25\\]\n\nNext, solve the equation for the small cakes:\n\\[\\frac{350x}{3} = 700\\]\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\\[350x = 2100\\]\nDivide both sides by 350:\n\\[x = 6\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of helpers required is \\(\\boxed","ground_truth":"B","predicted_answer":"E","is_correct":false,"was_retried":true}

The number of ways to choose 4 points out of 5 is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{k} \\), which represents the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) elements from a set of \\( n \\) elements without regard to the order of selection.

Since F is the center of the pentagon, it is equidistant from all the vertices A, B, C, D, and E. Therefore, any quadrilateral that includes F will have F as one of its vertices and will be formed by choosing 3 out of the 5 points A, B, C, D, and E. The number of ways to choose 3 points out of 5 is:\n\n\\[\n\\binom{5}{3} = \\frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \\frac{5!}{3! \\cdot 2!} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 3!}{3! \\cdot 2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 4}{2 \\cdot 1} = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 10 quadrilaterals that can be formed by including the point F.\n\nTo find the total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed, we add the number of quadrilaterals formed using only the points A, B, C, D, and\n\nThe total number of different quadrilaterals that can be formed by joining 4 of the points A, B, C, D, E, and F is \\( 5 + 10 = 15 \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\(\\boxed{D}\\).","ground_truth":"D","predicted_answer":"D","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?\n\nOptions:\nA)2 months\nB)4 months\nC)23 months\nD)24 months\nE)84 months","chain_of_thought":"The final answer is \\boxed{D}. After B joined the business, C joined after 24 months.\n<ans> D</ans>","full_output":"To determine how many months after B joined the business C joined, we need to calculate the ratio of the profits shared by A, B, and C based on their investments and the time each person was involved in the business.\n\nLet's denote the number of months after B joined as \\( x \\). Since B joined after 2 months, B was involved for \\( 12 - 2 = 10 \\) months. C joined after \\( 2 + x \\) months, so C was involved for \\( 12 - (2 + x) = 10 - x \\) months.\n\nThe profit sharing ratio is proportional to the product of the investment and the time each person was involved. Therefore, the ratio of the profits shared by A, B, and C is:\n\\[\n40000 \\times 12 : 60000 \\times 10 : 120000 \\times (10 - x)\n\\]\nSimplifying the ratio, we get:\n\\[\n480000 : 600000 : 120000(10 - x)\n\\]\nDividing each term by 120000, we get:\n\\[\n4 : 5 : (10 - x)\n\\]\nWe know that C's share of the profit is Rs.150,000 out of a total profit of Rs.375,000. Therefore, C's share of the profit is:\n\\[\n\\frac{150000}{375000} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\nThis means that C's part of the ratio \\( 4 : 5 : (10 - x) \\) is \\( \\frac{10 - x}{4 + 5 + (10 - x)} = \\frac{10 - x}{19 - x} \\). Setting this equal to \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\), we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{10 - x}{19 - x} = \\frac{2}{5}\n\\]\nCross-multiplying, we get:\n\\[\n5(10 - x) = 2(19 - x)\n\\]\nExpanding both sides, we get:\n\\[\n50 - 5x = 38 - 2x\n\\]\nRearranging terms\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{D}.

Calculate the initial number of yellow golf balls.\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the total number of golf balls sold.**\n\nThe store started with 600 golf balls and sold 80% of them. Therefore, the number of golf balls sold is:\n\\[ 600 \\times 0.80 = 480 \\]\n\n**Step 2: Determine how many white golf balls were sold.**\n\nThe store sold all of its white golf balls. Let \\( W \\) be the number of white golf balls at the beginning of the day. Therefore, the number of white golf balls sold is \\( W \\).\n\n**Step 3: Determine how many yellow golf balls were sold.**\n\nSince the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, the number of yellow golf balls sold is also \\( W \\). Therefore, the total number of golf balls sold is:\n\\[ W + W = 2W \\]\n\nWe know from Step 1 that the total number of golf balls sold is 480. So we can set up the equation:\n\\[ 2W = 480 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( W \\):\n\\[ W = \\frac{480}{2} = 240 \\]\n\n**Step 4: Calculate the initial number of yellow golf balls.**\n\nLet \\( Y \\) be the number of yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. The total number of golf balls at the beginning of the day is the sum of the yellow and white golf balls:\n\\[ Y + W = 600 \\]\n\nWe know from Step 3 that \\( W = 240 \\). Therefore:\n\\[ Y + 240 = 600 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( Y \\):\n\\[ Y = 600 - 240 = 360 \\]\n\nThus, the store had \\(\\boxed{360}\\) yellow golf balls to begin the day.","ground_truth":"E","predicted_answer":"E","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}
