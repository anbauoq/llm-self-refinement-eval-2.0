The total cost for all the sharpeners is 100 rupees, so we can write the second equation as:\n\n\\[ w(x + 1) + b(x) = 100 \\]\n\nWe can simplify the second equation by expanding and combining like terms:\n\n\\[ wx + w + bx = 100 \\]\n\\[ (w + b)x + w = 100 \\]\n\nSince we know from the first equation that \\( w + b = 18 \\), we can substitute 18 for \\( w + b \\) in the second equation:\n\n\\[ 18x + w = 100 \\]\n\nNow we have a system of two equations:\n\n1. \\( w + b = 18 \\)\n2. \\( 18x + w = 100 \\)\n\nWe can solve the first equation for \\( b \\):\n\n\\[ b = 18 - w \\]\n\nNext, we substitute \\( b = 18 - w \\) into the second equation:\n\n\\[ 18x + w = 100 \\]\n\nSince \\( w \\) and \\( b \\) are integers, let's try to find a value for \\( x \\) that makes \\( w \\) an integer. We can start by testing possible values for \\( x \\).\n\nIf \\( x = 5 \\):\n\\[ w = \\frac{100 - 18 \\cdot 5}{1} = \\frac{100 - 90}{1} = 10 \\]\n\\[ b = 18 - 10 = 8 \\]\n\nSo, if \\( x = 5 \\), then \\( w = 10 \\) and \\( b = 8 \\). Let's check if these values satisfy both equations:\n\n1. \\( w + b = 10 + 8 = 18 \\)\n\n<ans>10,8</ans> <br> <ans> C</ans> <br> <ans> <br> <ans> <br> <ans> <br> <ans> <br> <ans> <br> <ans> <br> <ans> <br> <ans> <br> <ans> <br> <ans> <br> <ans> <br> <答案> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>","ground_truth":"A","predicted_answer":"C","is_correct":false,"was_retried":true,"hint_sentence":"< hint> Jack bought more white sharpeners than brown sharpeners by 2. < hint> Jack spent 1 rupee more on white sharpeners than brown sharpeners. < hint> Jack bought 10 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners. < hint> Jack bought 7 white sharpeners and 8 brown sharpeners. < hint> Jack bought 5 white sharpeners and 6 brown sharpeners. < hint> Jack bought 11 white sharpeners and 12 brown sharpeners. < hint> Jack bought 9 brown sharpeners and 9 brown sharpeners. < hint> Jack bought 1 brown sharpeners and 1 brown sharpeners. < hint> Jack bought 2 brown sharpeners and brown brown sharpeners. < hint> Jack bought brown brown pencils. < duty> < attention> <本来 ste Leone brownarte brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown brown"}

Since \\(c + d = 6000\\), we have \\(6000 + f = 9000 - a - b\\), so \\(f = 3000 + a + b\\). This is possible, so the family could have 6 members.\n\nThus, the family has 6 members.
