The time taken for the return journey is 4 hours, and the speed during the return journey is \\( v + 12 \\) kilometers per hour.\n\nUsing the formula for distance, \\( \\text{distance} = \\text{speed} \\times \\text{time} \\), we can write two equations:\n1. For the forward journey: \\( d = v \\times 6 \\)\n2. For the return journey: \\( d = (v + 12) \\times 4 \\)\n\nSince both expressions represent the same distance \\( d \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\\[ v \\times 6 = (v + 12) \\times 4 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve this equation step by step:\n1. Distribute the 4 on the right side: \\( 6v = 4v + 48 \\)\n2. Subtract \\( 4v \\) from both sides to isolate \\( v \\): \\( 2v = 48 \\)\n3. Divide both sides by 2: \\( v = 24 \\)\n\nNow that we know the speed during the forward journey is 24 kilometers per hour, we can find the distance \\( d \\) by substituting \\( v \\) back into the equation for the forward journey:\n\\[ d = 24 \\times 6 = 144 \\]\n\nTherefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is \\(\\boxed{B}\\).","full_output":"To determine the distance travelled by the jeep, let's denote the distance by \\( d \\) kilometers and the speed of the jeep during the forward journey by \\( v \\) kilometers per hour. \n\nFrom the problem, we know two things:\n1.

Let's say:\n\n- The age of Q is \\( q \\)\n- The age of R is \\( r \\)\n- The age of T is \\( t \\)\n\nAccording to the problem, Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This can be expressed mathematically as:\n\n\\[ r - q = q - t \\]\n\nWe can rearrange this equation to:\n\n\\[ r + t = 2q \\]\n\nWe are also given that the sum of the ages of R and T is 50 years:\n\n\\[ r + t = 50 \\]\n\nSince both equations are equal to \\( r + t \\), we can set them equal to each other:\n\n\\[ 2q = 50 \\]\n\nSolving for \\( q \\), we get:\n\n\\[ q = \\frac{50}{2} = 25 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the difference between R and Q's age, which is \\( r - q \\). From the equation \\( r + t = 2q \\), we know that \\( r + t = 50 \\) and \\( q = 25 \\). We can substitute \\( q = 25 \\) back into the equation \\( r + t = 2q \\):\n\n\\[ r + t = 2 \\times 25 = 50 \\]\n\nSince \\( r + t = 50 \\) and we already know that \\( r + t = 50 \\), we need to find \\( r - q \\).

Substituting \\( r = 50 - t \\) into the equation \\( r - 25 = 25 - t \\), we get:\n\n\\[ (50 - t) - 25 = 25 - t \\]\n\\[ 50 - t - 25 = 25 - t \\]\n\\[ 25 = 25 \\]\n\nThis confirms that the equations are consistent. To find \\( r - q \\), we can use the fact that \\( r = 25 + x \\) and \\( t = 25 - x \\). Since \\( r - q = x \\), we can find \\( x \\) by solving the equation \\( r + t = 50 \\):\n\n\\[ (25 + x) + (25 - x) = 50 \\]\n\\[ 50 = 50 \\]\n\nThis means that \\( x \\) can be any value, but the difference \\( r - q \\) is always 25.

we need to calculate how many large and small cakes each helper can produce in the given time and then find the total number of helpers needed to meet the required production.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the production capacity of each helper in the given time:\n- Each helper can make 2 large cakes/hr. In 3 hours and 20 minutes (which is \\(3 + \\frac{20}{60} = 3 + \\frac{1}{3} = \\frac{10}{3}\\) hours), each helper can make \\(2 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{20}{3} \\approx 6.67\\) large cakes.\n- Each helper can make 35 small cakes/hr. In 3 hours and 20 minutes, each helper can make \\(35 \\times \\frac{10}{3} = \\frac{350}{3} \\approx 116.67\\) small cakes.\n\nNext, we need to find out how many helpers are required to produce 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes. Let's denote the number of helpers by \\(h\\).\n\nThe total number of large cakes produced by \\(h\\) helpers is \\(h \\times \\frac{20}{3}\\).

Therefore, \\(h \\geq 6\\). However, we need to check if a smaller number of helpers can meet both conditions by considering the integer values.\n\nIf \\(h = 6\\):\n- Large cakes: \\(6 \\times \\frac{20}{3} = 40\\) (which is more than 20)\n- Small cakes: \\(6 \\times \\frac{350}{3} = 700\\) (which is exactly 700)\n\nSince \\(h = 6\\) satisfies both conditions, the minimum number of helpers required is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).\n\nHowever, afteriting the correct option letter (A–E).

The sum of the squares of the digits is 109: \\( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 \\).\n3. If we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number with the digits in reverse order: \\( 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a \\).\n\nLet's start with the third piece of information:\n\\[ 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a \\]\nSubtract \\( 10b \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 100a + c - 495 = 100c + a \\]\nSubtract \\( a \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 99a + c - 495 = 100c \\]\nSubtract \\( c \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 99a - 495 = 99c \\]\nDivide both sides by 99:\n\\[ a - 5 = c \\]\nSo, we have \\( c = a - 5 \\).\n\nNow substitute \\( c = a - 5 \\) into the first two equations. Starting with the sum of the digits:\n\\[ a + b + (a - 5) = 17 \\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ 2a + b - 5 = 17 \\]\nAdd 5 to both sides:\n\\[ 2a + b = 22 \\]\nSo, we have \\( b = 22 - 2a \\).\n\nNext, substitute \\( c = a - 5 \\) into the sum of the squares of the digits:\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 + (a - 5)^2 = 109 \\]\nExpand \\( (a - 5)^2 \\):\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 + a^2 - 10a + 25 = 109 \\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ 2a^2 + b^2 - 10a + 25 = 109 \\]\nSubtract 25 from both sides:\n\\[ 2a^2 + b^2 - 10a = 84 \\]\nSubstitute \\( b = 22 - 2a \\) into the equation:\n\\[ 2a^2 + (22 - 2a)^2 - 10a = 84 \\]\nExpand \\( (22 - 2a)^2 \\):\n\\[ 2a^2 + 484 - 88a + 4a^2 - 10a = 84 \\]\nCombine like terms:\n\\[ 6a^2 - 98a + 484 = 84 \\]\nSubtract 84 from both sides:\n\\[ 6a^2 - 98a + 400 = 0 \\]\nDivide the entire equation by 2:\n\\[ 3a^2 - 49a + 200 = 0 \\]\n\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\( a = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\), where \\( a = 3 \\), \\( b = -49 \\), and \\( c = 200 \\):\n\\[ a = \\frac{49 \\pm \\sqrt{(-49)^2 - 4 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 200}}{2 \\cdot 3} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{49 \\pm \\sqrt{2401 - 2400}}{6} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{49 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{6} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{49 \\pm 1}{6} \\]\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\\[ a = \\frac{50}{6} = \\frac{25}{3} \\quad \\text{(not an integer)} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{48}{6} = 8 \\quad \\text{(integer)} \\]\n\nSo, \\( a = 8 \\). Substitute \\( a = 8 \\) back into the equation \\( b = 22 - 2a \\):\n\\[ b = 22 - 2 \\cdot 8 = 22 - 16 = 6 \\]\nAnd substitute \\( a = 8 \\) into the equation \\( c = a - 5 \\):\n\\[ c = 8 - 5 = 3 \\]\n\nTherefore, the three-digit number is \\( 863 \\). However, we need to check the options given. The correct option is \\(\\boxed{A}\\).\n\nThe correct answer is \\(\\boxed{A}\\).","ground_truth":"A","predicted_answer":"A","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Therefore, the sequence is:\n   \\[\n   -50, -49, -48, \\ldots, -50 + (k-1)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the last integer in the sequence:**\n   The last integer is:\n   \\[\n   -50 + (k-1) = -50 + k - 1 = k - 51\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:**\n   The sum \\( S \\) of the first \\( k \\) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( n = k \\), the first term is -50, and the last term is \\( k - 51 \\).

Therefore, the sequence is:\n   \\[\n   -50, -49, -48, \\ldots, -50 + (k-1)\n   \\]\n\n2. **Find the last integer in the sequence:**\n   The last integer is:\n   \\[\n   -50 + (k-1) = -50 + k - 1 = k - 51\n   \\]\n\n3. **Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:**\n   The sum \\( S \\) of the first \\( k \\) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:\n   \\[\n   S = \\frac{n}{2} \\times (\\text{first term} + \\text{last term})\n   \\]\n   Here, \\( n = k \\), the first term is -50, and the last term is \\( k - 51 \\).

Rearrange it to standard form:\n   \\[\n   k^2 - 101k - 102 = 0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Factor the quadratic equation:**\n   We need to find two numbers that multiply to -102 and add up to -101. These numbers are -102 and 1.
