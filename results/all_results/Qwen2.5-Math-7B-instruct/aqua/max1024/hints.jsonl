This can be simplified to 2:3.\n- The total parts in alloy X are \\(6 + 9 = 15\\).\n- The amount of zinc in 40 grams of alloy X is \\(\\frac{6}{15} \\times 40 = \\frac{2}{5} \\times 40 = 16\\) grams.\n- The amount of copper in 40 grams of alloy X is \\(\\frac{9}{15} \\times 40 = \\frac{3}{5} \\times 40 = 24\\) grams.\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the amount of zinc and copper in 60 grams of alloy Y.**\n\nThe ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Y is 7:11.\n- The total parts in alloy Y are \\(7 + 11 = 18\\).\n- The amount of zinc in 60 grams of alloy Y is \\(\\frac{7}{18} \\times 60 = \\frac{7}{3} \\times 10 = \\frac{70}{3} \\approx 23.33\\) grams.\n- The amount of copper in 60 grams of alloy Y is \\(\\frac{11}{18} \\times 60 = \\frac{11}{3} \\times 10 = \\frac{110}{3} \\approx 36.67\\) grams.\n\n**Step 3: Add the amounts of zinc from both alloys to get the total zinc in alloy Z.**\n\n- Total zinc in alloy Z is \\(16 + \\frac{70}{3} = \\frac{48}{3} + \\frac{70}{3} = \\frac{118}{3} \\approx 39.33\\) grams.\n\n**Step 4: Add the amounts of copper from both alloys to get the total copper in alloy Z.**\n\n- Total copper in alloy Z is \\(24 + \\frac{110}{3} = \\frac{72}{3} + \\frac{110}{3} = \\frac{182}{3} \\approx 60.67\\) grams.\n\n**Step 5: Determine the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z.**\n\n- The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is \\(\\frac{118}{3} : \\frac{182}{3} = 118 : 182\\).\n- This ratio can be simplified by dividing both terms by their greatest common divisor, which is 2: \\(118 \\div 2 = 59\\) and \\(182 \\div 2 = 91\\).\n\nTherefore, the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is \\(\\boxed{D}\\).\nPredicted incorrect answer: D\nCorrect answer: <MSK>\n\n returned only 1–3 hint sentences, wrapped inside a single < hint>... < hint> block, with no extra commentary and without stating correct answer.

We know the selling price is $1.25, so we set up the equation:\n     \\[\n     1.20C = 1.25\n     \\]\n   - To find \\( C \\), divide both sides by 1.20:\n     \\[\n     C = \\frac{1.25}{1.20} = \\frac{125}{120} = \\frac{25}{24}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the cost price of one bag of ice is \\( \\frac{25}{24} \\) dollars.\n\n2. **Calculate the profit per bag of ice:**\n   - The profit per bag is the selling price minus the cost price:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Profit per bag} = 1.25 - \\frac{25}{24}\n     \\]\n   - Convert 1.25 to a fraction with a denominator of 24:\n     \\[\n     1.25 = \\frac{125}{100} = \\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{36}{24}\n     \\]\n   - Now subtract the cost price:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Profit per bag} = \\frac{36}{24} - \\frac{25}{24} = \\frac{11}{24}\n     \\]\n   - Therefore, the profit per bag of ice is \\( \\frac{11}{24} \\) dollars.\n\n3. **Calculate the total profit for 500 bags of ice:**\n   - Multiply the profit per bag by the number of bags sold:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Total profit} = 500 \\times \\frac{11}{24} = \\frac{500 \\times 11}{24} = \\frac{5500}{24} = \\frac{2750}{12} = 229.17\n    ]\n   -
