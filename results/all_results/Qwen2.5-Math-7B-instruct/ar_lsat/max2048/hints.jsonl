Let's denote the positions of the compositions as follows: \\( F, \\_ , \\_ , \\_ , O, \\_ , \\_ , \\_ \\).\n\nSince there are exactly two compositions between F and O, we can place them in the second and third positions or the fourth and fifth positions, and so on. However, we need to ensure that the conditions are satisfied.\n\nLet's consider the possible positions for T and R:\n- If T is immediately before F, then the sequence must be \\( T, F, \\_ , \\_ , O, \\_ , \\_ , \\_ \\). This means that there are three compositions between F and O, which contradicts the condition that there are exactly two compositions between F and O. Therefore, T cannot be immediately before F.\n- If T is immediately after R, then the sequence must be \\( \\_ , R, T, F, \\_ , \\_ , \\_ \\). This means that there are exactly two compositions between F and O, which satisfies the condition.\n\nSo, the sequence must be \\( \\_ , R, T, F, \\_ , \\_ , \\_ \\).\n\nNow, we need to place O in the fifth position, P before S, and L or H in the eighth position. The remaining positions are 1, 6, and 7. Since O is in the fifth position, we have:\n\\[ \\_ , R, T, F, O, \\_ , \\_ \\]\n\nWe need to place P before S and L or H in the eighth position.

In the sequence \\( \\_ , R, T, F, O, P, S, L \\), S is after O, so this condition is satisfied. In the sequence \\( \\_ , R, T, F, O, P, S, H \\), S is after O, so this condition is also satisfied.\n\nNow, we need to determine the position of R.

This means we have Kayne and Jaramilo assigned, and we need one more ambassador. Since Novetze cannot be assigned if Kayne is assigned (by rule 1), this pair is impossible.\n\n- ** Pair B: Jaramilo and Ong**\n  - If Jaramilo is assigned, Kayne must also be assigned (by rule 2).

The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.

{"id":"ar_lsat_201110_2-G_2_11","question":"A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\n\nWhich one of the following CANNOT be true?\nA) Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\nB) Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\nC) Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.\nD) Landon is not assigned to an ambassadorship.\nE) Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.","chain_of_thought":"To determine which of the given options cannot be true, we need to analyze the constraints step by step and see if each option is feasible.\n\n1. **Constraint 1**: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.\n2. **Constraint 2**: If Jaramilo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.\n3. **Constraint 3**: If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.\n4. **Constraint 4**: If Lander is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: Jaramilo is assigned as ambassador to Zamb**\n- If Jaramilo is assigned to Zamb, then by Constraint 2, Kayne must also be assigned to an ambassadorship.\n- Since Kayne is assigned to an ambassadorship, by Constraint 1, Novetzke cannot be assigned to an ambassadorship.\n- This leaves us with Ong and Lander to be assigned to the remaining two countries (Venezuel and Yemen). If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then by Constraint 3, Kayne cannot be assigned to Yemen, which is a contradiction because Kayne is already assigned to an ambassadorship. Therefore, Ong cannot be assigned to Venezuela, and Lander must be assigned to Zamb. However, this would mean that both Jaramilo and Lander are assigned to Zamb, which is not possible since no ambassador is assigned to more than one country.

If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, then by Constraint 3, Kayne cannot be assigned to York, which is not a contradiction because Kayne is not assigned to an ambassadorship. Therefore, Ong can be assigned to Venezuela, and Lander can be assigned to Zamb. This is a valid assignment. Therefore, Option C can be true.\n\n**Option D: Lander is not assigned to an ambassadorship**\n- If Lander is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Jaramilo cannot be assigned to Zamb (by Constraint 4).\n- This leaves us with Kayne and Novetzke to be assigned to the remaining two countries (Venezuel and York).

sessions that meet on the same day.**\n3. **Nessa must lead an afternoon session.**\n4. **Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.**\n\nSince Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, Olivia must lead her session on Friday afternoon (because Julio's session must be earlier than Olivia's).\n\nThis leaves us with the following sessions to assign:\n- Wednesday morning\n- Wednesday afternoon\n- Friday morning\n- Friday afternoon\n\nWe know:\n- Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.\n- Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.\n- Nessa must lead an afternoon session (which is already assigned to Olivia).\n\nSince Olivia leads Friday afternoon, Nessa cannot lead Friday afternoon. Therefore, Nessa must lead Wednesday afternoon.\n\nNow we have:\n- Wednesday morning\n- Wednesday afternoon (Nessa)\n- Friday morning\n- Friday afternoon (Olivia)\n\nSince Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, they must both lead either Wednesday morning or Friday morning. However, since Olivia leads Friday afternoon, they cannot both lead Friday morning. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must both lead Wednesday morning.\n\nThis leaves us with:\n- Wednesday morning (Kevin and Rebecca)\n- Wednesday afternoon (Nessa)\n- Friday morning\n- Friday afternoon (Olivia)\n\nSince Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, Lan must lead Friday morning.\n\nThis leaves us with:\n- Wednesday morning (Kevin and Rebecca)\n- Wednesday afternoon (Nessa)\n- Friday morning (Lan)\n- Friday afternoon (Olivia)\n\nAt this point, we have assigned sessions to Kevin, Nessa, Lan, and Olivia. The only lab assistants left to assign are Olivia and Nessa, but they have already been assigned sessions. Therefore, we can determine the sessions for Kevin, Nessa, Lan, and Olivia, but not for Olivia or Nessa.\n\nThus, the number of other lab assistants for whom we can determine the sessions

{"id":"ar_lsat_201206_3-G_4_22","question":"During a recital, two pianists—Wayne and Zara—will perform solos. There will be five solos altogether, performed one immediately after another. Each solo will be either a modern piece or a traditional piece. The choice of pianist and type of piece for the solos must conform to the following conditions: The third solo is a traditional piece. Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively. In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece. The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modem piece.\n\nIf in the fifth solo Wayne performs a traditional piece, which one of the following could be true?\nA) Zara performs the first solo.\nB) Wayne performs the second solo.\nC) Zara performs the third solo.\nD) The second solo is a modem piece.\nE) The fourth solo is a traditional piece.","chain_of_thought":"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and determine the possible order of the solos. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Condition 1**: The third solo is a traditional piece.\n2. **Condition 2**: Exactly two of the traditional pieces are performed consecutively.\n3. **Condition 3**: In the fourth solo, either Wayne performs a traditional piece or Zara performs a modern piece.\n4. **Condition 4**: The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo.\n5. **Condition 5**: No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.\n\nWe are given that in the fifth solo Wayne performs a traditional piece. Let's denote the solos as follows: \\( S_1, S_2, S_3, S_4, S_5 \\).\n\nSince \\( S_3 \\) is a traditional piece and \\( S_5 \\) is a traditional piece, and exactly two traditional pieces are performed consecutively, the only possible consecutive pair of traditional pieces is \\( S_3 \\) and \\( S_4 \\). Therefore, \\( S_4 \\) must be a traditional piece.\n\nNow, we know:\n- \\( S_3 \\) is a traditional piece.\n- \\( S_4 \\) is a traditional piece.\n- \\( S_5 \\) is a traditional piece.\n\nThis means that \\( S_1 \\) and \\( S_2 \\) must both be modern pieces.

Since \\( S_4 \\) is a traditional piece, Wayne must perform the fourth solo.\n- **Condition 4**: The pianist who performs the second solo does not perform the fifth solo. Since \\( S_5 \\) is a traditional piece, Zara cannot perform the second solo.\n- **Condition 5**: No traditional piece is performed until Wayne performs at least one modern piece.

Since the problem asks for which target could be 2 days, and we have no further information to exclude either option, we need to consider the logical consistency of the conditions.\n\nGiven that Solide's voicemail target is shorter than Truvest's website target, and Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, it is more likely that \\(W_S\\) is less than \\(W_T\\). Therefore, the most logical conclusion is:\n\n\\(\\boxed{B}\\) is the most likely option based on logical consistency and conditions.\nfinal answer is

The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.\n\nWhich one of the following, if substituted for the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, would have the same effect in determining the order in which the bands perform?\nA) Only Uneasy can perform in a later slot than Xpert.\nB) Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring, which performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.\nC) Vegemite and Wellspring each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.\nD) Xpert performs either immediately before or immediately after Uneasy.\nE) Xpert performs in either slot five or slot six.","chain_of_thought":"To determine which constraint would have the same effect as \"Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than X pert,\" let's analyze each option and see how it affects the possible orderings of the bands.\n\n**Original Constraint:**\n- Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than X pert.\n\n**Option A:**\n- Only Uneasy can perform in a later slot than X pert.\nThis means that X pert must perform in one of the first three slots (since if X pert were in the fourth slot or later, Uneasy would have to perform in a later slot, which would violate the original constraint). This is the same as saying Wells spring and Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than X pert.\n\n**Option B:**\n- Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Wells spring, which performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.\nThis implies that Vegemite, Wells spring, and Zircon must perform in consecutive slots in the order Vegemite, Wells spring, Zircon.

For example, if Wells spring is in slot 2, Zircon is in slot 3, and X pert is in slot 5, the original constraint is satisfied, but if X pert is in slot 4, the original constraint is still satisfied, but this option would not allow X pert to be in slot 4.\n\n**Option C:**\n- Vegemite and Wells spring each perform in an earlier slot than X pert.\nThis is the same as the original constraint.\n\n**Option D:**\n- X pert performs either immediately before or immediately after Uneasy.\nThis does not necessarily ensure that Wells spring and Zircon perform in an earlier slot than X pert.

The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.\n2. The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.\n3. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwen Hall.\n4. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.\n5. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwen Hall.\n\nLet's denote the lectures by their bird types: O (oystercatchers), P (petrels), R ( rail), S (sandpipers), T (terns). We need to place these lectures in the five days, keeping in mind the conditions.\n\nFrom condition 1, the first lecture is in Gladwen Hall. So, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Day 1: G} \\]\nwhere G is any bird type except S (since S is in Howard auditorium).\n\nFrom condition 2, the fourth lecture is in Howard auditorium. So, we can write:\n\\[ \\text{Day 4: H} \\]\nwhere H is any bird type except G (since G is in Gladwen Hall).\n\nFrom condition 3, exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwen Hall. So, we have two more lectures in Gladwen Hall and two more in Howard auditorium.\n\nFrom condition 4, the lecture on sandpipers (S) is in Howard auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers (O). So, S must be in one of the first three days, and O must be in one of the last four days. Since O cannot be on Day 1 (G is there) and O cannot be on Day 4 (H is there), O must be on one of the days 2, 3, or 5.\n\nFrom condition 5, the lecture on terns (T) is given earlier than the lecture on petrels (P), and P is in Gladwen Hall. So, T must be in one of the first three days, and P must be in one of the last four days. Since P cannot be on Day 1 (G is there) and P cannot be on Day 4 (H is there), P must be on one of the days 2, 3, or 5.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible placements:\n- Since S is in Howard auditorium and O is in Gladwen Hall, S cannot be on Day 2 or Day 3 if O is on Day 2 or Day 3. Therefore, S must be on Day 2 and O must be on Day 3.\n- Since P is in Gladwen Hall and T is in Howard auditorium, T must be on Day 2 and P must be on Day 3. However, this is not possible because S is already on Day 2 and O is already on Day 3.\n\nLet's try another possibility:\n- S must be on Day 3, O must be on Day 5.\n- T must be on Day 2, P must be on Day 3.

The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.

If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.\n\nIf exactly four of the photographers are assigned to the graduation ceremonies, then which one of the following must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony?\nA) Frost\nB) Gonzalez\nC) Knutson\nD) Lai\nE) Mays","chain_of_thought":"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the constraints and determine which photographer must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony if exactly four photographers are assigned to the graduation ceremonies.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.\n2. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.\n3. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thone University ceremony.\n4. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thone University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.\n\nWe need to find a valid assignment of exactly four photographers such that the constraints are satisfied. Let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n**Case 1: Frost and Heideck are assigned together to the Silva University ceremony.**\n- This means we have already assigned 2 photographers to the Silva University ceremony.\n- We need to assign 2 more photographers to either the Silva University ceremony or the Thone University ceremony.\n- If Lai and Mays are both assigned, they must be to different ceremony. So one of them goes to the Silva University ceremony and the other goes to the Thone University ceremony.\n- If Lai is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Mays must be assigned to the Thone University ceremony. This gives us the assignment: Silva University: Frost, Heideck, Lai; Thone University: Mays.\n- If Mays is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thone University ceremony. This gives us the assignment: Silva University: Frost, Heideck, Mays; Thone University: Lai.\n- In both sub-cases, Lai and Mays are assigned to different ceremonies, and Gonzalez is not assigned to the Silva University ceremony. Therefore, the only photographer assigned to the Silva University ceremony is either Lai or Mays.\n\n**Case 2: Frost and Heideck are assigned together to the Thone University ceremony.**\n- This means we have already assigned 2 photographers to the Thone University ceremony.\n- We need to assign 2 more photographers to either the Silva University ceremony or the Thone University ceremony.\n- If Lai and Mays are both assigned, they must be to different ceremony. So one of them goes to the Silva University ceremony and the other goes to the Thone University ceremony.\n- If Lai is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Mays must be assigned to the Thone University ceremony. This gives us the assignment: Silva University: Lai; Thone University: Frost, Heideck, Mays.\n- If Mays is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thone University ceremony. This gives us the assignment: Silva University: Mays; Thone University: Frost, Heideck, Lai.\n- In both sub-cases, Lai and Mays are assigned to different ceremonies, and Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony. Therefore, the only photographer assigned to the Silva University ceremony is either Lai or Mays.\n\n**Case 3: Frost and Heideck are not assigned together.**\n- This means we need to consider the constraints for the remaining photographers.\n- If we assignrite the constraints, we find that it is not possible to satisfy all constraints with exactly four photographers assigned without either Lai or Mays being assigned to the same ceremony as Heideck or Frost.\n\nFrom the analysis, we see that the only valid assignments are either Lai or Mays being assigned to the Silva University ceremony. Therefore, the must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony is either Lai or Mays. Since we need to return only one option letter, we can choose either Lai or Mays. However, the problem states that exactly four photographers are assigned, and we need to find the must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony. The only logical conclusion is that Mays must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\boxed{E}","full_output":"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the constraints and determine which photographer must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony if exactly four photographers are assigned to the graduation ceremonies.\n\nLet's break down the constraints:\n\n1. Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.\n2. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.\n3. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thone University ceremony.\n4. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thone University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.\n\nWe need to find a valid assignment of exactly four photographers such that the constraints are satisfied. Let's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n**Case 1: Frost and Heideck are assigned together to the Silva University ceremony.**\n- This means we have already assigned 2 photographers to the Silva University ceremony.\n- We need to assign 2 more photographers to either the Silva University ceremony or the Thone University ceremony.\n- If Lai and Mays are both assigned, they must be to different ceremony. So one of them goes to the Silva University ceremony and the other goes to the Thone University ceremony.\n- If Lai is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Mays must be assigned to the Thone University ceremony. This gives us the assignment: Silva University: Frost, Heideck, Lai; Thone University: Mays.\n- If Mays is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thone University ceremony. This gives us the assignment: Silva University: Frost, Heideck, Mays; Thone University: Lai.\n- In both sub-cases, Lai and Mays are assigned to different ceremonies, and Gonzalez is not assigned to the Silva University ceremony. Therefore, the only photographer assigned to the Silva University ceremony is either Lai or Mays.\n\n**Case 2: Frost and Heideck are assigned together to the Thone University ceremony.**\n- This means we have already assigned 2 photographers to the Thone University ceremony.\n- We need to assign 2 more photographers to either the Silva University ceremony or the Thone University ceremony.\n- If Lai and Mays are both assigned, they must be to different ceremony. So one of them goes to the Silva University ceremony and the other goes to the Thone University ceremony.\n- If Lai is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Mays must be assigned to the Thone University ceremony. This gives us the assignment: Silva University: Lai; Thone University: Frost, Heideck, Mays.\n- If Mays is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thone University ceremony. This gives us the assignment: Silva University: Mays; Thone University: Frost, Heideck, Lai.\n- In both sub-cases, Lai and Mays are assigned to different ceremonies, and Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony. Therefore, the only photographer assigned to the Silva University ceremony is either Lai or Mays.\n\n**Case 3: Frost and Heideck are not assigned together.**\n- This means we need to consider the constraints for the remaining photographers.\n- If we assignrite the constraints, we find that it is not possible to satisfy all constraints with exactly four photographers assigned without either Lai or Mays being assigned to the same ceremony as Heideck or Frost.\n\nFrom the analysis, we see that the only valid assignments are either Lai or Mays being assigned to the Silva University ceremony. Therefore, the must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony is either Lai or Mays. Since we need to return only one option letter, we can choose either Lai or Mays. However, the problem states that exactly four photographers are assigned, and we need to find the must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.

The number of ways to arrange these 4 blocks is \\(4!\\).\n   \\[\n   4! = 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 24\n   \\]\n   Within the AB block, Book A and Book B can be arranged in 2 different ways (AB or BA).

{"id":"ar_lsat_201510_3-G_3_17","question":"Exactly five students—Grecia, Hakeem, Joe, Katya, and Louise—are to work at a campus art gallery during a special exhibit that runs for exactly five days, Monday through Friday. Each day is divided into two nonoverlapping shifts—first and second—with each student working exactly two shifts. Each shift is worked by exactly one of the students according to the following scheduling restrictions: No student works both shifts of any day. On two consecutive days, Louise works the second shift. On two nonconsecutive days, Grecia works the first shift. Katya works on Tuesday and Friday. Hakeem and Joe work on the same day as each other at least once. Grecia and Louise never work on the same day as each other.\n\nIf there is at least one day on which Grecia and Joe both work at the gallery, then which one of the following could be true?\nA) Grecia works the first shift on Tuesday.\nB) Hakeem works the second shift on Monday.\nC) Hakeem works the second shift on Wednesday.\nD) Joe works the first shift on Wednesday.\nE) Joe works the first shift on Thursday.","chain_of_thought":"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given constraints step by step and determine the possible schedule for the students. Let's start by listing the constraints again:\n\n1. No student works both shifts of any day.\n2. On two consecutive days, Louise works the second shift.\n3. On two nonconsecutive days, Grecia works the first shift.\n4. Katya works on Tuesday and Friday.\n5. Hakeem and Joe work on the same day as each other at least once.\n6. Grecia and Louise never work on the same day as each other.\n\nWe need to find a schedule where Grecia and Joe both work at the gallery on at least one day, and then determine which of the given options could be true.\n\nLet's start by placing Katya on Tuesday and Friday. This means Katya works the first shift on Tuesday and the first shift on Friday. Therefore, she cannot work on Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nNext, we know that Louise works the second shift on two consecutive days. The possible pairs of consecutive days are Monday-Tuesday, Tuesday-Wednesday, Wednesday-Thursday, and Thursday-Friday. However, since Katya works on Tuesday and Friday, Louise cannot work on Tuesday or Friday. Therefore, the only possible pair for Louise is Wednesday-Thursday. This means Louise works the second shift on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nNow, we need to place Grecia, who works the first shift on two nonconsecutive days. The possible pairs of nonconsecutive days are Monday-Wednesday, Monday-Thursday, Monday-Friday, Tuesday-Thursday, Tuesday-Friday, and Wednesday-Friday. Since Louise works on Wednesday and Thursday, Grecia cannot work on Wednesday or Thursday. Therefore, the possible pairs for Grecia are Monday-Wednesday, Monday-Thursday, Monday-Friday, and Tuesday-Friday. However, since Katya works on Tuesday, Grecia cannot work on Tuesday. Therefore, the only possible pair for Grecia is Monday-Friday. This means Grecia works the first shift on Monday and Friday.\n\nNow, we have the following schedule so far:\n- Monday: Grecia (first shift), Hakeem or Joe (second shift)\n- Tuesday: Katya (first shift)\n- Wednesday: Louise (second shift)\n- Thursday: Louise (second shift)\n- Friday: Grecia (first shift), Hakeem or Joe (second shift)\n\nSince Hakeem and Joe work on the same day as each other at least once, they must both work on either Monday or Friday. Let's consider the two cases:\n\n**Case 1: Hakeem and Joe both work on Monday.**\n- Monday: Grecia (first shift), Hakeem (second shift)\n- Tuesday: Katya (first shift)\n- Wednesday: Louise (second shift)\n- Thursday: Louise (second shift)\n- Friday: Grecia (first shift), Joe (second shift)\n\nIn this case, Grecia works the first shift on Monday and Friday, and Joe works the second shift on Friday. This satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, Joe works the first shift on Thursday is not true.\n\n**Case 2: Hakeem and Joe both work on Friday.**\n- Monday: Grecia (first shift), Hakeem (second shift)\n- Tuesday: Katya (first shift)\n- Wednesday: Louise (second shift)\n- Thursday: Louise (second shift)\n- Friday: Grecia (first shift), Joe (second shift)\n\nIn this case, Grecia works the first shift on Monday and Friday, and Joe works the second shift on Friday. This satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, Joe works the first shift on Thursday is not true.\n\nSince both cases result in Joe working the second shift on Friday, we need to check the other options. Let's check if any of the other options could be true:\n\n**Option A: Grecia works the first shift on Tuesday.**\n- Monday: Hakeem or Joe (first shift)\n- Tuesday: Grecia (first shift)\n- Wednesday: Louise (second shift)\n- Thursday: Louise (second shift)\n- Friday: Grecia (first shift), Hakeem or Joe (second shift)\n\nThis is not possible because Grecia cannot work the first shift on both Monday and Tuesday.\n\n**Option B: Hakeem works the second shift on Monday.**\n- Monday: Grecia (first shift), Hakeem (second shift)\n- Tuesday: Katya (first shift)\n- Wednesday: Louise (second shift)\n- Thursday: Louise (second shift)\n- Friday: Grecia (first shift), Hakeem or Joe (second shift)\n\nThis is possible and satisfies all the constraints.\n\n**Option C: Hakeem works the second shift on Wednesday.**\n- Monday: Grecia (first shift), Hakeem (second shift)\n- Tuesday: Katya (first shift)\n- Wednesday: Hakeem (second shift)\n- Thursday: Louise (second shift)\n- Friday: Grecia (first shift), Hakeem or Joe (second shift)\n\nThis is not possible because Hakeem cannot work the second shift on Wednesday and Friday.\n\n**Option D: Joe works the first shift on Wednesday.**\n- Monday: Grecia (first shift), Hakeem or Joe (second shift)\n- Tuesday: Katya (first shift)\n- Wednesday: Joe (first shift)\n- Thursday: Louise (second shift)\n- Friday: Grecia (first shift), Hakeem or Joe (second shift)\n\nThis is not possible because Joe cannot work the first shift on Wednesday and Friday.\n\n**Option E: Joe works the first shift on Thursday.**\n- Monday: Grecia (first shift), Hakeem or Joe (second shift)\n- Tuesday: Katya (first shift)\n- Wednesday: Louise (second shift)\n- Thursday: Joe (first shift)\n- Friday: Grecia (first shift), Hakeem or Joe (second shift)\n\nThis is not possible because Joe cannot work the first shift on Thursday and Friday.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{B}.","full_output":"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given constraints step by step and determine the possible schedule for the students.

{"id":"ar_lsat_201606_2-G_3_15","question":"During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.\n\nWhich one of the following CANNOT be the antique auctioned on the day immediately preceding the day on which the vase is auctioned?\nA) the harmonica\nB) the lamp\nC) the mirror\nD) the sundial\nE) the table","chain_of_thought":"To determine which antique cannot be auctioned on the day immediately preceding the day on which the vase is auctioned, let's analyze the given conditions step by step.\n\n1. **Sundial (S) is not auctioned on June 1st.**\n2. **If the harmonica (H) is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp (L), then the mirror (M) is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.**\n3. **The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase (V).**\n4. **The table (T) is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.**\n\nLet's consider the possible positions of the sundial (S) and see how it affects the other antiques.\n\n### Case 1: Sundial (S) is on June 2nd\n- mirror (M) must be on June 3rd or later.\n- vase (V) must be on June 3rd or later.\n- table (T) must be on June 1st or June 2nd.\n\nIf T is on June 1st, then H or V must be on June 2nd (S), but T is already on June 1st.

Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.\n\nIf U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?\nA) R is mentioned in chapter 1.\nB) R is mentioned in chapter 5.\nC) S is mentioned in chapter 7.\nD) W is mentioned in chapter 6.\nE) X is mentioned in chapter 4.","chain_of_thought":"<ans> C </ans> <br>`\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{C}.

{"id":"ar_lsat_201612_3-G_2_9","question":"An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.\n\nIf Z is mentioned in chapter 7, which one of the following could be true?\nA) R is mentioned in chapter 3.\nB) S is mentioned in chapter 3.\nC) T is mentioned in chapter 4.\nD) U is mentioned in chapter 1.\nE) X is mentioned in chapter 5.","chain_of_thought":"To solve this problem, we need to follow the given constraints step by step and determine the possible arrangement of the clues.\n\n1. **Constraint 1**: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.\n2. **Constraint 2**: T must be mentioned before W.\n3. **Constraint 3**: There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.\n4. **Constraint 4**: S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.\n5. **Constraint 5**: W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.\n6. **Constraint 6**: U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.\n\nWe are given that Z is mentioned in chapter 7. Let's start by placing Z in chapter 7 and then determine the possible positions for the other clues.\n\nSince there are exactly two chapters separating T from W, and T must be mentioned before W, the possible pairs of positions for T and W are:\n- (1, 4)\n- (2, 5)\n- (3, 6)\n- (4, 7)\n\nHowever, since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, the possible pairs are:\n- (2, 5)\n- (3, 6)\n- (4, 7)\n\nLet's analyze each case:\n\n**Case 1: T is in chapter 2 and W is in chapter 5**\n- Z is in chapter 7.\n- T is in chapter 2.\n- W is in chapter 5.\n- U and X must be adjacent.\n- S and Z cannot be adjacent.\n\nThe remaining chapters are 1, 3, 4, and 6. Since U and X must be adjacent, they can be in chapters (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), or (4, 5). However, chapter 2 is already occupied by T and chapter 5 is already occupied by W, so the only possible pair for U and X is (3, 4). This gives us:\n- U in chapter 3.\n- X in chapter 4.\n\nThe remaining clues S and V can be in chapters 1 and 6. Since S and Z cannot be adjacent, S cannot be in chapter 6. Therefore, S must be in chapter 1 and V must be in chapter 6. This gives us:\n- S in chapter 1.\n- V in chapter 6.\n- U in chapter 3.\n- X in chapter 4.\n- T in chapter 2.\n- W in chapter 5.\n- Z in chapter 7.\n\nIn this case, R can be mentioned in any chapter except 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. Therefore, R can be mentioned in chapter 6, but not in chapter 3. So option A is not true.\n\n**Case 2: T is in chapter 3 and W is in chapter 6**\n- Z is in chapter 7.\n- T is in chapter 3.\n- W is in chapter 6.\n- U and X must be adjacent.\n- S and Z cannot be adjacent.\n\nThe remaining chapters are 1, 2, 4, and 5.

This gives us:\n- U in chapter 4.\n- X in chapter 5.\n\nThe remaining clues S and V can be in chapters 1 and 2. Since S and Z cannot be adjacent, S cannot be in chapter 2. Therefore, S must be in chapter 1 and V must be in chapter 2.

{"id":"ar_lsat_201612_3-G_2_10","question":"An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.\n\nWhich one of the following could be true?\nA) R is mentioned in chapter 7.\nB) T is mentioned in chapter 5.\nC) U is mentioned in chapter 7.\nD) W is mentioned in chapter 3.\nE) X is mentioned in chapter 6.","chain_of_thought":"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given constraints and determine which of the options could be true.

Since there must be exactly two chapters between T and W, we can represent this as:\n\\[ T, \\_, \\_, W \\]\n\nThis means T can be in chapters 1, 2, or 3 (since it cannot be in chapter 1, it must be in chapters 2 or 3). Let's consider each case:\n\n**Case 1: T is in chapter 2**\n\\[ T, \\_, \\_, W \\]\nThis leaves us with chapters 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 to fill with S, Z, U, and X.

This satisfies all constraints.\n- If (U, X) is in chapters 6 and 7, then we have:\n  \\[ T, \\_, \\_, W, \\_, (U, X) \\]\n  We need to place S and Z in chapters 3, 4, and 5.

{"id":"ar_lsat_201612_3-G_3_12","question":"At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.\n\nWhich one of the following could be an accurate list of the paintings displayed in the lower position on walls 1 through 4, listed in that order?\nA) Franz's oil, Franz's watercolor, Greene's oil, Isaacs's oil\nB) Franz's oil, Hidalgo's watercolor, Isaacs's watercolor, Isaacs's oil\nC) Greene's oil, Franz's oil, Isaacs's oil, Hidalgo's oil\nD) Hidalgo's oil, Greene's oil, Greene's watercolor, Isaacs's oil\nE) Hidalgo's watercolor, Franz's oil, Greene's oil, Isaacs's oil","chain_of_thought":"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and determine the possible arrangement of the paintings on the walls. Let's break down the conditions step by step:\n\n1. **No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.**\n2. **No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.**\n3. **No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.**\n4. ** green's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.**\n5. **Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.**\n\nFrom condition 5, we know that on wall 4, the lower position is occupied by Isaacs's oil. Therefore, the upper position on wall 4 must be occupied by either Franz's watercolor, Hialdo's watercolor, or Greene's watercolor. However, since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, wall 4 cannot have Franz's watercolor. Therefore, the upper position on wall 4 must be occupied by either Hialdo's watercolor or Greene's watercolor.\n\nFrom condition 4, we know that green's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Franz's oil must be displayed on wall 1, 2, or 3, and the upper position on that wall must be occupied by Greene's watercolor. This means that wall 4 cannot have Greene's watercolor in the upper position, so it must have Hialdo's watercolor in the upper position.\n\nNow we know:\n- Wall 4: Hialdo's watercolor, Isaacs's oil\n\nNext, we need to place Franz's oil on wall 1, 2, or 3, and the upper position on that wall must be occupied by Greene's watercolor.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the constraints:**\n   - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.\n   - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.\n   - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.\n   - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.\n   - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.\n\n2. **Determine the position of Franz and Greene:**\n   - Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, Franz must be on a wall with a watercolor in the upper position and a painting in the lower position. This means Franz cannot be on wall 4 (since Isaacs's oil is on wall 4).\n\n3. **Determine the position of Hida go:**\n   - Hida go's oil is displayed on wall 2. This means wall 2 has a painting in the lower position. Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, wall 2 must have a watercolor in the upper position. This means wall 2 has both a watercolor and an oil.\n\n4. **Determine the position of Isaacs:**\n   - Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 4. This means wall 4 has a painting in the lower position. Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, wall 4 must have a watercolor in the upper position. This means wall 4 has both a watercolor and an oil.\n\n5. **Determine the possible positions for Franz:**\n   - Since Franz cannot be on wall 4, he must be on either wall 1, wall 2, or wall 3. However, since wall 2 already has both a watercolor and an oil, Franz cannot be on wall 2. Therefore, Franz must be on either wall 1 or wall 3.\n\n6. **Determine the possible positions for Greene:**\n   - Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, Greene must be on either wall 2 or the wall that has Franz's oil. Since Franz cannot be on wall 2, Greene must be on the wall that has Franz's oil. Therefore, if Franz is on wall 1, Greene must be on wall 1. If Franz is on wall 3, Greene must be on wall 3.\n\n7. **Determine the possible positions for Hida go and Isaacs:**\n   - Since wall 2 already has both a watercolor and an oil, Hida go's watercolor must be in the upper position and Franz's oil must be in the lower position. This means if Franz is on wall 1, Hida go's watercolor is on wall 2 and Franz's oil is on wall 2. This means Franz cannot be on wall 1. Therefore, Franz must be on wall 3.\n   - If Franz is on wall 3, then Greene must also be on wall 3. This means wall 3 has both a watercolor and an oil. Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, wall 3 must have a watercolor in the upper position and a painting in the lower position. This means wall 3 has both a watercolor and an oil. Therefore, Hida go's watercolor must be on wall 2 and Franz's oil must be on wall 2. This means Hida go's watercolor cannot be on wall 2. Therefore, Hida go's oil must be on wall 1.\n\n8. **Determine the possible positions for Hida go and Isaacs:**\n   - Since wall 1 already has both a watercolor and an oil, Hida go's oil must be on wall 1 and Hida go's watercolor must be on wall 2. This means wall 1 has both a watercolor and an oil. Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, wall 1 must have a watercolor in the upper position and a painting in the lower position.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the constraints:**\n   - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.\n   - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.\n   - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.\n   - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.\n   - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.\n\n2. **Determine the position of Franz and Greene:**\n   - Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, Franz must be on a wall with a watercolor in the upper position and a painting in the lower position. This means Franz cannot be on wall 4 (since Isaacs's oil is on wall 4).\n\n3. **Determine the position of Hida go:**\n   - Hida go's oil is displayed on wall 2. This means wall 2 has a painting in the lower position. Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, wall 2 must have a watercolor in the upper position. This means wall 2 has both a watercolor and an oil.\n\n4. **Determine the position of Isaacs:**\n   - Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 4. This means wall 4 has a painting in the lower position. Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, wall 4 must have a watercolor in the upper position. This means wall 4 has both a watercolor and an oil.\n\n5. **Determine the possible positions for Franz:**\n   - Since Franz cannot be on wall 4, he must be on either wall 1, wall 2, or wall 3. However, since wall 2 already has both a watercolor and an oil, Franz cannot be on wall 2. Therefore, Franz must be on either wall 1 or wall 3.\n\n6. **Determine the possible positions for Greene:**\n   - Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, Greene must be on either wall 2 or the wall that has Franz's oil. Since Franz cannot be on wall 2, Greene must be on the wall that has Franz's oil. Therefore, if Franz is on wall 1, Greene must be on wall 1. If Franz is on wall 3, Greene must be on wall 3.\n\n7. **Determine the possible positions for Hida go and Isaacs:**\n   - Since wall 2 already has both a watercolor and an oil, Hida go's watercolor must be in the upper position and Franz's oil must be in the lower position. This means if Franz is on wall 1, Hida go's watercolor is on wall 2 and Franz's oil is on wall 2. This means Franz cannot be on wall 1. Therefore, Franz must be on wall 3.\n   - If Franz is on wall 3, then Greene must also be on wall 3. This means wall 3 has both a watercolor and an oil. Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, wall 3 must have a watercolor in the upper position and a painting in the lower position. This means wall 3 has both a watercolor and an oil. Therefore, Hida go's watercolor must be on wall 2 and Franz's oil must be on wall 2. This means Hida go's watercolor cannot be on wall 2. Therefore, Hida go's oil must be on wall 1.\n\n8. **Determine the possible positions for Hida go and Isaacs:**\n   - Since wall 1 already has both a watercolor and an oil, Hida go's oil must be on wall 1 and Hida go's watercolor must be on wall 2. This means wall 1 has both a watercolor and an oil. Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, wall 1 must have a watercolor in the upper position and a painting in the lower position. This means wall 1 has both a watercolor and an oil. Therefore, Hida go's watercolor must be on wall 2. This means wall 2 has both a watercolor and an oil. Therefore, Hida go's oil cannot be on wall 2. Therefore, Hida go's watercolor must be on wall 2.

Let's analyze each option:\n\n**Option A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.**\nThis is not possible because Franz's oil is already on Wall X, and Greene's watercolor is also on Wall X. Therefore, Option A cannot be true.\n\n**Option B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hida go's oil.**\nThis is possible. Wall X could be Franz's oil, Greene's watercolor, and Hida go's oil, and Wall 4 could be Isaacs's oil and an unknown painting.\n\n**Option C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.**\nThis is possible. Wall X could be Franz's oil, Greene's watercolor, and an unknown painting in the lower position, and Wall 4 could be Isaacs's oil and an unknown painting in the lower position.\n\n**Option D: Hida go's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.**\nThis is possible. Wall X could be Franz's oil, Greene's watercolor, and Hida go's oil, and Wall 4 could be Isaacs's oil and Hida go's watercolor.\n\n**Option E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hida go's oil.**\nThis is possible. Wall 4 could be Isaacs's oil and Hida go's oil, and Wall X could be Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor.\n\nTherefore, the option that CANNOT be true

{"id":"ar_lsat_201612_3-G_4_19","question":"Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings\n\nWhich one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?\nA) RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower

for one other building of the same class\n- This trade does not change the total number of buildings in each class.\n- Therefore, the class distribution remains the same.\n\n### Trade Type 2: Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings\n- This trade decreases the number of class 1 buildings by 1 and increases the number of class 2 buildings by 2.\n- For example, if RealProp trades its

{"id":"ar_lsat_201612_3-G_4_21","question":"Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings\n\nIf RealProp owns only class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?\nA) Trustcorp owns a class 1 building.\nB) Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building.\nC) Southco owns a class 2 Building.\nD) Southco owns both of the class 3 buildings.\nE) Southco owns the Flores Tower.","chain_of_thought":"To determine which statement must be true if RealProp owns only class 2 buildings after some number of trades, let's analyze the initial conditions and the possible trades step by step.\n\n**Initial Conditions:**\n- RealProp: Garza Tower (class 1), Ying House (class 3), Zimmer House (class 3)\n- Southco: Flores Tower (class 1), Lynch Building (class 2)\n- Trustcor: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), Ortiz Building (class 2)\n\n**Trade Options:**\n1.
