It is not clear what exactly it means for someone to \"kill the powerplay.\"\n\n3. **Consider the context:**\n   - In ice hockey, a powerplay is typically short-term and used to gain an advantage over the opponent. It is not an action that can be \"killed\" in the sense of removing it from existence.\n   - If Tuukka Rask scored a goal or took a shot that caused the powerplay to end, it would be more appropriate to say \"Tuukka Rask scored a goal or took a shot that ended the powerplay.\"\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - Given the analysis, the sentence \"Tuukka Rask killed the powerplay\" is not plausible in the context of ice hockey. It uses a non-standard term and does not accurately describe a typical ice hockey scenario.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\boxed{0}","ground_truth":"1","predicted_answer":"0","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}
