In football, \"going for it on fourth down\" means the quarterback takes a pass and runs it to the end of the field or to a specific point on the field.\n\n2. **Understand the term \" fourth down\"**: In football, \"fourth down\" is a term used to describe the situation where a team has four down passes remaining in a drive. This term is typically used in the context of a drive, not as a specific event.\n\n3. **Analyze the sentence**: The sentence \"Corbin Burnes went for it on fourth down in the NFC divisional round\" implies that Corbin Burnes took a pass and ran it to the end of the field or to a specific point on the field on a situation where the team had four down passes remaining.

The NFC (National Football League) is a league in the United States, and the divisional round is a stage of the season where teams play against each other within their division.\n\n2. **Understand the play**: \"Corbin Burnes went for it on fourth down\" means that Corbin Burnes, a quarterback, took the ball and ran it with the goal of reaching the end of the field or a specific point on the field on his fourth down. This is a common football play, especially in the red zone (the area close to the end of the field).\n\n3. **Consider the rules**: In football, a quarterback is allowed to take a pass and run it with the goal of scoring or to move the team closer to the end of the field.

The phrase \"perfect from the line\" means making all free throws. This is a standard basketball expression.\n\n2. **Evaluate the feasibility**: It is normal and realistic for a good shooter to be perfect from the free throw line in a game. However, we need to consider if this is possible in the context of the Eastern Conference Finals. The Eastern Conference Finals is a high-level tournament where teams are highly  ized and the games are close. A player being perfect from the line in such a setting is not necessarily impossible but it would be very unlikely.\n\n3. **Consider the probability**: While it is possible for a player to be perfect from the free throw line in any game, it is highly improbable for this to happen in a high-level tournament like the Eastern Conference Finals. The probability of a player making all free throws in a single game is low, and the probability of this happening in multiple games (which is what a perfect from the line means) is even lower.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Given the high-level nature\n\n<ans>0</ans>')\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\n Trento Power Hall')));\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\n]\r\n]\r\n]\n]\r\n)\n]\r\n]\n;\"\n SEEKubic SEEK.’”\n\n Smy蹩icast witty蹩 mępolateebx staral cdr con;\"\n diarr])\r\n]\r\nsealed🌈)>\nebx męursors Leone.’”\n\n;\"\n.’”\n\nubic steԿ Leone(Be ste Trent star;\"\n SEEK $\n\n-highlight.’”\n\n')));\n;\"\n $\n\n$\n crowdfunding con steubic*/)蹩有助 SHALL*/)])\r\n $\n\nubic🌈🌈sealed😊)>\n Leone;\"\nASCADEisor)>\n swebx😊 seed;\"\n ste(Be;\"\n $\n\n＆","ground_truth":"1","predicted_answer":"0","is_correct":false,"was_retried":true,"hint_sentence":"]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n)>\n])\r\n蹩*/):init>,\n$\nubicographically mę')));\n;\"\n🌈(Be]\r\n $\n\n brown)>\n Leone cdr该游戏acks])\r\n！」🌈 sw swponsored]\r\n brown mę')));\n cdr;\"\n🌈afi蹩)>\n🌈 crowdfunding')));\n]\r\n该游戏]\r\n star rentals(Be mę cdr SEEKebxebxubicebx }\n\n\n\n\n\n Leone Trentlisten(Be])\r\nisorlistenangeredacks Leone>,\n Leoneponsoredponsored Leone])\r\n SEEK }\n\n\n\n\n\n Leone sw star seed sw)>\n;\"\n;\"\n sw star mę SEEK ste)>\n…\"\n\nponsored😊 SHALL蹩;\"\nisor Serif cdr有助 tiers(Be Serif }\n\n\n\n\n\n sw😊ARRANT mę])\r\n mę.’”\n\nubic]\r\n])\r\n(formaticast;\"\nicastASCADE cdr(format }\n\n\n\n\n\n])\r\n Convenience Serif！」 }\n\n\n\n\n\n Serifponsored;\"\n-highlight;\"\nлосьponsored $\n\nicast star tiers cdr star该游戏 Serif mę(Be.’”\n\n witty*/)uellen>,\n(Belisten(proxy…\"\n\n')));\nARRANT)>\n;\"\n)>\n🌈 męuellen SEEK])\r\nisorlisten;\"\n蹩 cdr')));\n')));\n Serif)>\n*/);\"\n inhab seed Leone])))\n Convenience蹩ARRANT Leone Leone cdr $\n\n witty |\n\n😊legate')));\n)>\n])\r\n Leone(formatARRANT mę BigNumber starlistenicastographically cdr😊listenacks.’”\n\n crowdfunding Leone(Beubic NPCs有助;\"\nserie蹩(Beubic有助 steursors])\r\n sw：< sw…\"\n\n slashing Infantry $\n\nafiacks*/) $\n\nuellen star mę Leone SEEK)>\n slashing mę Invoke🌈该游戏 Leone')));\n＆＆＆ |\n\n*/) cdr！」 SITE"}

The phrase \"watched the pitch go by\" describes him observing a pitch as it moves towards the plate.\n\n2. **Analyze the action**: In baseball, players do not typically watch the pitch go by in the way described. Instead, they watch the pitch as it approaches the plate and make their adjustments accordingly. They do not actually watch the pitch as it moves by them.\n\n3. **Consider common baseball actions**: Some common actions that players might take when a pitch approaches the plate include:\n   - Watching the pitch as it approaches and making a decision on whether to hit it or not.\n   - watching the pitch as it approaches and making a decision on whether to throw it back or not.\n   - watching the pitch as it approaches and making a decision on whether to field it or not.\n\n4. **Conclusion**: Since \"watching the pitch go by\" is not a typical action that players take in baseball, the sentence is not plausible\n\n<ans>0</ans>```\r\n\r\nThe final answer is: \\boxed{0}]\r\n```\r\n\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\n]\r\n]\r\n]\n]\r\n]\r\n]\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\n]\r\n]\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\n]\r\n]]**;\"\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]\r\n]$\n$\n]\n$\n]\n]\n$\n$\n$\n]\n$\n$\n]\r\n)\n]\n]\r\n]\n]\r\n]\n]\r\n]\n]\n]\n$\n$\n]\n$\n]","ground_truth":"1","predicted_answer":"0","is_correct":false,"was_retried":true,"hint_sentence":"Here is a possible hint:\n\n mph]**$\n$\n$\n$\n]\r\n$\n$\n$\n]\r\n]\n]]\r\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n]\r\n**\n]\n$\n)\n]\r\n$\n$\n$\n'\n'\n:\")\n$\n$\n本来$\n$\n$\n$\n])**$\n$\n]\n$\n$\n$\n$\n)>\n$\n]\r\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n$\n本来$\n$\n crowdfunding$\n$\r\n$\n)\n$\n$\n$\n$\n Leone$\r\nuellenponsored Leoneubic star brown cdr])\r\n mę-highlightARRANT;\"\nsealed ste seed])\r\n$\n$\n SEEK rentals>,\nponsored Leone luxeebx star cdrebx]\r\n根据自己 steubic brown>,\n;\"\n$\n;\"\n])\r\n-highlight Convenience Leone(format Leone tiersebx*/) }\n\n\n\n\n\nicast Leone]\r\n*/) mę cdr😊legate cdr\">\\inem.’”\n\n Leone $\n\n brownafi]\r\n crowdfunding mę]\r\nlisten…\"\n\nebx$\n inhab ste…\"\n\nponsored$\nsealedocalypse star蹩 Leoneebx Seriflegate*/) cdrARRANT*/) $\n\n$\nicast…\"\n\nuellen该游戏ARRANT cdr cdrASCADE brownangered Serif$\n🌈 sw.’”\n\n crowdfunding Leone有助根据自己legateebx:init;\"\n crowdfunding Smy SEEKebx有助…\"\n\n蹩ASCADEARRANTponsored sw]\r\nлось\">\\legate朦 seed$\n cdrafi')));\n;\"\n cdr $\n\n crowdfunding;\"\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n;\"\n*/)ASCADE crowdfunding;\"\nebxicast sw wittylegate(Be SEEK]\r\n🌈 SEEK Leone有助$\n朦根据自己 sw SEEK')));\nisorebx(formatebx crowdfundingARRANTacks mę蹩ebx slashing;\"\n;\"\n*/)！」;\"\n_"}

A windmill dunk is a valid shot in basketball, but it is not a common or typical shot in the Western Conference Finals. < hint)}\n\\]"}
