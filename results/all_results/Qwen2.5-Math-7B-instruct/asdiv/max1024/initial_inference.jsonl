To proceed, we will assume that the number of beads in each necklace is such that the total number of beads required is a multiple of 15. Let's assume each necklace has \\(x\\) beads. Then the total number of beads required is \\(15x\\).\n\nSince we need to use all the beads Betty has, we need to find out how many more beads she needs. If she has 367 beads, the number of beads she needs is \\(15x - 367\\). However, since we don't have the value of \\(x\\), we need to find a value of \\(x\\) such that \\(15x\\) is greater than or equal to 367 and is a whole number.\n\nLet's find the smallest integer value of \\(x\\) such that \\(15x \\geq 367\\):\n\n\\[x = \\left\\lceil \\frac{367}{15} \\right\\rceil\\]\n\nCalculating the division:\n\n\\[\\frac{367}{15} \\approx 24.4667\\]\n\nRounding up to the nearest whole number, we get:\n\n\\[x = 25\\]\n\nSo, each necklace will have 25 beads. The total number of beads required for 15 necklaces is:\n\n\\[15 \\times 25 = 375\\]\n\nNow, we need to find out how many more beads Betty needs:\n\n\\[375 - 367 = 8\\]\n\nTherefore, Betty needs \\(\\boxed{8}\\) more beads.","ground_truth":"8","predicted_answer":"8","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Define Variables:**\n   Let \\( D \\) be the cost of the DVD player.\n   Let \\( M \\) be the cost of the movie.\n\n2. **Set Up the Ratio:**\n   According to the problem, the ratio of the cost of the DVD player to the cost of the movie is 9:2. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{D}{M} = \\frac{9}{2}\n   \\]\n   This implies:\n   \\[\n   D = \\frac{9}{2}M\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set Up the Price Difference:**\n   The problem also states that the DVD player costs $63 more than the movie. This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   D = M + 63\n   \\]\n\n4. **Substitute the Expression for \\( D \\):**\n   Substitute \\( D = \\frac{9}{2}M \\) into the equation \\( D = M + 63 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{2}M = M + 63\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( M \\):**\n   To isolate \\( M \\), first subtract \\( M \\) from both sides:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{2}M - M = 63\n   \\]\n   Convert \\( M \\) to a fraction with a common denominator:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{2}M - \\frac{2}{2}M = 63\n   \\]\n   Combine the fractions:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7}{2}M = 63\n   \\]\n   Multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \\( \\frac{7}{2} \\):\n   \\[\n   M = 63 \\times \\frac{2}{7}\n   \\]\n   Simplify the right-hand side:\n   \\[\n   M = 9 \\times 2 = 18\n   \\]\n\n6. **Find the Cost of the DVD Player:**\n   Now that we know \\( M = 18 \\), substitute \\( M \\) back into the equation \\( D = \\frac{9}{2}M \\):\n   \\[\n   D = \\frac{9}{2} \\times 18\n   \\]\n   Simplify the right-hand side:\n   \\[\n   D = 9 \\times 9 = 81\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the cost of the DVD player is \\(\\boxed{81}\\).","ground_truth":"81","predicted_answer":"81","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Now, take the divisor (12) and divide it by the remainder (6):\n   \\[\n   12 \\div 6 = 2 \\quad \\text{with a remainder of} \\quad 12 - 2 \\times 6 = 0\n   \\]\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the divisor at this step (6) is the GCD of 18 and 12.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of envelopes Russom can make is \\(\\boxed{6}\\).","ground_truth":"6","predicted_answer":"6","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Since the problem doesn't specify the exact number of packages, we'll assume she has at least one package of 4 candies.\n\nIf she has one package of 4 candies and she eats 10 candies, she would need to have at least 1 more package of 4 candies to have enough candies to eat 10. Therefore, the minimum number of candies she could have is 8 candies (4 from one package + 4 from another package).\n\nIf she has 2 packages of 4 candies, she would have 8 candies initially. After eating 10 candies, she would have:\n\n\\[ 8 - 10 = -2 \\]\n\nSince she cannot have a negative number of candies, it means she needs at least 2 more candies to have enough to eat 10 candies. Therefore, she needs at least 3 packages of 4 candies to have enough candies to eat 10 candies.\n\nIf she has 3 packages of 4 candies, she would have 12 candies initially. After eating 10 candies, she would have:\n\n\\[ 12 - 10 = 2 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of candies she has left is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]","ground_truth":"2","predicted_answer":"2","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

This means that for every 6 units of length, there are 5 units of width. We are also given that the length of the rectangle is 24 inches.\n\nFirst, we need to determine the factor by which the ratio is scaled to match the actual length of the rectangle. Since the length is 24 inches and the ratio part for length is 6, we can find the scaling factor by dividing the actual length by the ratio part for length:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Scaling factor} = \\frac{24}{6} = 4\n\\]\n\nThis means that every unit in the ratio is scaled up by a factor of 4 to get the actual dimensions of the rectangle. Therefore, the width, which corresponds to the ratio part of 5, can be found by multiplying the ratio part for width by the scaling factor:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Width} = 5 \\times 4 = 20\n\\]\n\nSo, the width of the rectangle is \\boxed{20} inches.","ground_truth":"20","predicted_answer":"20","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}
