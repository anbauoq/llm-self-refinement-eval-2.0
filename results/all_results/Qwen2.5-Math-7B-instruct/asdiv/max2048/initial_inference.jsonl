family will get out of one gallon, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Convert gallons to ounces:**\n   - We know that 1 gallon = 4 quarts.\n   - Each quart = 32 ounces.\n   - Therefore, \\( 4 \\text{ quarts} \\times 32 \\text{ ounces per quart} = 128 \\text{ ounces} \\).\n\n2. **Determine the amount of orange juice per serving:**\n   - Each person gets one 6-ounce glass of orange juice.\n   - Let's assume the family has \\( n \\) members. Each member gets 6 ounces, so the total amount of orange juice consumed per day is \\( 6n \\) ounces.\n\n3. **Calculate the number of servings per gallon:**\n   - The total amount of orange juice in one gallon is 128 ounces.\n   - The total amount of orange juice consumed per day by the family is \\( 6n \\) ounces.\n   - To find the number of days the family can get orange juice from one gallon, we divide the total amount of orange juice in one gallon by the amount consumed per day:\n     \\[\n     \\text{Number of days} = \\frac{128 \\text{ ounces}}{6n \\text{ ounces per day}} = \\frac{128}{6n}\n     \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the fraction:**\n   - Simplify \\( \\frac{128}{6n} \\):\n     \\[\n     \\frac{128}{6n} = \\frac{64}{3n}\n     \\]\n\n5. **Determine the number of whole servings:**\n   - Since we are asked for whole servings, we need to find the integer part of \\( \\frac{64}{3n} \\).\n\nGiven that the problem does not specify the number of family members \\( n \\), we can only express the number of whole servings in terms of \\( n \\). However, if we assume \\( n \\) is an integer, we can find specific values by testing different values of \\( n \\).\n\nFor example, if the family has 2 members:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of whole servings} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{64}{3 \\times 2} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{64}{6} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor 10.6667 \\right\\rfloor = 10\n\\]\n\nTo find the correct number of whole servings for a specific family size, you would substitute the actual number of family members \\( n \\) into the expression \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{64}{3n} \\right\\rfloor \\).\n\nGiven the problem statement, it appears there is a specific value for \\( n \\) that was not provided. If we assume a typical family size of 4 members, we can calculate:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Number of whole servings} = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{64}{3 \\times 4} \\right\\rfloor = \\left\\lfloor \\frac{64}{12}

Calculate how many tarts are needed to fill 10 boxes with the same number of tarts.\n2. Subtract the number of tarts she already has from the total number of tarts needed.\n\nFirst, let's find out how many tarts are needed to fill 10 boxes with the same number of tarts. Since we want each box to have the same number of tarts, we need to divide the total number of tarts by the number of boxes. However, since we want to find out how many more tarts she needs to make, we need to round up to the next whole number if there is a remainder.\n\nLet's do the division:\n\\[ 85 \\div 10 = 8.5 \\]\n\nSince we can't have half a tart in a box, we need to round up to the next whole number. So, each box will have 9 tarts. Therefore, the total number of tarts needed is:\n\\[ 10 \\times 9 = 90 \\]\n\nNow, we subtract the number of tarts she already has from the total number of tarts needed:\n\\[ 90 - 85 = 5 \\]\n\nSo, Mrs. Dalloway should make \\boxed{5} more tarts.","full_output":"To determine how many more tarts Mrs. Dalloway should make, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1.

{"id":784,"question":"A library buys 4,305 new books. If it wants to shelve them equally onto 83 shelves, how many more new books should be purchased?","chain_of_thought":"To determine how many more new books should be purchased so that they can be equally distributed onto 83 shelves, we need to find the remainder when 4,305 is divided by 83. The remainder will tell us how many more books are needed to make the total number of books divisible by 83.\n\nFirst, we perform the division of 4,305 by 83:\n\n\\[ 4305 \\div 83 \\approx 51.9 \\]\n\nThe integer part of the quotient is 51. This means that 83 can be multiplied by 51 to find out how many books are already accounted for:\n\n\\[ 83 \\times 51 = 4233 \\]\n\nNext, we subtract this product from the total number of books to find the remainder:\n\n\\[ 4305 - 4233 = 72 \\]\n\nThe remainder is 72, which means that after shelving 4,233 books, there are 72 books left over. To make the total number of books divisible by 83, we need to add enough books to make the remainder zero.

This means that for every 8 boys, there are 5 girls.\n\nWe know that there are 30 girls at the game. To find out how many boys there are, we need to set up a proportion based on the ratio. Let's denote the number of boys by \\( B \\).\n\nThe ratio of boys to girls can be written as:\n\\[\n\\frac{B}{30} = \\frac{8}{5}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( B \\), we can cross-multiply:\n\\[\n5B = 8 \\times 30\n\\]\n\\[\n5B = 240\n\\]\n\nNext, we isolate \\( B \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:\n\\[\nB = \\frac{240}{5}\n\\]\n\\[\nB = 48\n\\]\n\nSo, there are 48 boys at the game. To find out how many more boys there are than girls, we subtract the number of girls from the number of boys:\n\\[\n48 - 30 = 18\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are \\(\\boxed{18}\\) more boys than girls.","ground_truth":"18","predicted_answer":"18","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

According to the problem, tuition costs $704 more than room and board, so the tuition cost can be expressed as \\( R + 704 \\). The total cost for tuition plus room and board is given as $2,584. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:\n\n\\[ R + (R + 704) = 2584 \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation, we get:\n\n\\[ 2R + 704 = 2584 \\]\n\nNext, we need to isolate \\( R \\). We do this by subtracting 704 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ 2R = 2584 - 704 \\]\n\\[ 2R = 1880 \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( R \\) by dividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ R = \\frac{1880}{2} \\]\n\\[ R = 940 \\]\n\nSo, the cost of room and board is $940. Since tuition costs $704 more than room and board, we can find the tuition cost by adding $704 to $940:\n\n\\[ \\text{Tuition} = 940 + 704 = 1644 \\]\n\nTherefore, the tuition fee is \\(\\boxed{1644}\\).","ground_truth":"1644","predicted_answer":"1644","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Let's denote the number of waffle cones sold as \\( w \\).\n\nThe ratio of sugar cones to waffle cones can be written as:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{4} = \\frac{45}{w}\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( w \\), we can use cross-multiplication:\n\\[\n5w = 4 \\times 45\n\\]\n\nFirst, we calculate \\( 4 \\times 45 \\):\n\\[\n4 \\times 45 = 180\n\\]\n\nSo, the equation becomes:\n\\[\n5w = 180\n\\]\n\nNext, we solve for \\( w \\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:\n\\[\nw = \\frac{180}{5}\n\\]\n\nPerforming the division:\n\\[\nw = 36\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the number of waffle cones sold is \\(\\boxed{36}\\).","ground_truth":"36","predicted_answer":"36","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}
