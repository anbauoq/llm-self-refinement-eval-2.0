However, this information does not directly indicate how many songs he knows. The problem states that he knows 18 different chords, but it does not specify if these chords correspond to different songs. Therefore, we must assume he knows 18 songs.\n\n3. **Re-evaluate the problem statement:**\n   - The problem states that Billy can play 24 songs in his music book. This suggests that there are 24 songs that he can play, which might include the 18 chords he knows plus additional songs. However, the problem also states that he knows 18 different chords, which might mean he only knows 18 songs.\n\n4. **Correct interpretation:**\n   - Based on the problem statement, it seems there might be a misunderstanding.

This number is known as the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 14.\n\nFirst, we note that 13 and 14 are coprime, meaning they have no common factors other than 1. Therefore, their LCM is simply the product of the two numbers:\n\\[\n\\text{LCM}(13, 14) = 13 \\times 14\n\\]\n\nNext, we perform the multiplication:\n\\[\n13 \\times 14 = 182\n\\]\n\nThis means that the smallest total number of birds Bill could have observed is 182. Since the number of sparrows and parrots is the same, we divide this total by 2 to find the number of sparrows:\n\\[\n\\text{Number of sparrows} = \\frac{182}{2} = 91\n\\]\n\nThus, the smallest number of sparrows Bill could have observed is \\(\\boxed{91}\\).","ground_truth":"182","predicted_answer":"91","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false,"hint_sentence":"The final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{91}\n\\] unknown}))\n👇结晶 seed)>\n)>\n cdrARRANTlegateARRANT(format:\";\n🌈 star(Be)>\n starDM…\"\n\n |\n\n#+')));\n*/)…\"\n\n/readXML🌈 Leone Leone starinemafi*/)\">\\ sw;\"\n(proxy cdr Leone(proxyponsored.’”\n\n])))\n\">\\(proxyafi cdr🌈legate tiers seed;\"\n;\"\n star NPCs rentalslegate }\n\n\n\n\n\nŃ wittyԿ\">\\朦])\r\n蹩afi(Be mę Leoneebx有助 cdr star cdr*/)*/) Convenience-highlightlisten seed*>&)>\n Leone Leone cdr SEEK Convenience seedisor(format crowdfunding cdr Serif starponsoredlegate SEEK primary |\n\n $\n\n cdr🌈;\"\n Convenience🌈])))\n该游戏 mę SITE该游戏uellenuellen cdr star🌈;\"\n الأعمال mę SHALL primary🌈*>& crowdfunding有助ponsored diarr(format luxeponsored;\"\n')));\nsealed(formatlegate.’”\n\n(Be ste SITE caloricast\">\\遊uellen🌈朦 SEEKlegate sw蹩蹩afi star')));\n该游戏ponsored！」 steuellen SerifARRANTacks(format cdr\">\\\">\\ cdr ste cdr;\"\n])))\n🌈*>&isorXMLARRANT Jaune(formatlisten SEEK steebxafiursors(format(formaticast.’”\n\nafi.’”\n\n cdrubiclegate tiersXML*/) Leoneebx*/)isor;\"\n cdr(format calor calor primaryursors_Msglegate朦icast＆ crowdfunding star Leone])\r\n cdr cdr Convenience)>\n SEEKuellenubiciples*>&isor NPCs;\"\n starARRANT;\"\n(proxyASCADE(proxy luxe(proxyisor star\">\\*>& SEEK'il\">\\ Convenience stelegatelisten sw)>\n＆(proxy SerifisorARRANT slashing SEEK seed>,\nuellen crowdfunding NPCsponsored ste SEEK蹩 tiers蹩 seed cdr)>\n SEEK Convenience }\n\n\n\n\n\n.’”\n\n Leoneuellenafi朦afi cdr(Be Serif SEEK*/);\"\n该游戏蹩 }\n\n\n\n\n\n mę Convenienceponsored该游戏ASCADE\">\\ebxursorsuellen')));\n])\r\n*/) }\n\n\n\n\n\nebx cdrperienced cdr…\"\n\nisor(Be calor.’”\n\nlegate Leone $\n\nuellen\">\\该游戏…\"\n\n $\n\nicast🌈*/) الأعمال有助])))\n mę蹩朦ASCADE(proxy seed;\"\n cdrisor！」*>& mę Leone🌈legate(proxy')));\n }\n\n\n\n\n\n.’”\n\n Serif Leone Serif保费 LeoneebxARRANT NPCs cdr star该游戏legate sw;\"\n_\n\nafi LeoneARRANTisoruellenponsored diarr！」;\"\n;\"\n(format！」🌈朦 ste蹩 NPCs！」(Be该游戏#+蹩 rentals $\n\n🌈 witty Leone crowdfunding calor Serif cdr cdr保费 seed)>\n witty $\n\n sw…\"\n\n🌈 starebx！」🌈 LeoneicastARRANTponsoredackslegate*/))>\n'il蹩afi…\"\n\n🌈孑 sw SEEK…\"\n\n |\n\n🌈 NPCsponsored ste…\"\n\n😊 |\n\n)>\n |\n\n wittylisten cdr蹩 star;\"\nsealedafi！」🌈＆(format $\n\n inhabuellenponsored😊(Be calor)>\nicast cdrebxponsoredafi＆…\"\n\nARRANT cdr;\"\n slashingisor SITEXML witty męASCADE inhab Leone primary $\n\nisor wittyubic🌈*>& NPCs_\n\n hamstring $\n\n witty slashingacks crowdfunding seed蹩(Be cdr(format该游戏 Convenience*>&afilegatelegate męicast Serif"}
