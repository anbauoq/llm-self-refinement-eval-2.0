Since she has 8 yellow envelopes, we can find the number of green envelopes by multiplying 8 by 3.\n   \\[\n   8 \\times 3 = 24\n   \\]\n   So, Kiera has 24 green envelopes.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of envelopes:**\n   To find the total number of envelopes, we add the number of blue envelopes, yellow envelopes, and green envelopes together.\n   \\[\n   14 + 8 + 24 = 46\n   \\]\n   So, Kiera has 46 envelopes in total.\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{46}\n\\]","ground_truth":"46","predicted_answer":"46","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Here are the steps:\n\n1. Identify the total number of apples: 495.\n2. Identify the number of apples in each basket: 25.\n3. Perform the division: \\(495 \\div 25\\).\n\nTo do the division, we can use long division. Here's how it works:\n\n- 25 goes into 49 once (since \\(25 \\times 1 = 25\\)). Write 1 above the division bar.\n- Subtract 25 from 49 to get 24.\n- Bring down the next digit, which is 5, to make it 245.\n- 25 goes into 245 nine times (since \\(25 \\times 9 = 225\\)). Write 9 above the division bar next to the 1.\n- Subtract 225 from 245 to get 20.\n\nSince 20 is less than 25, we stop the division here. The quotient is 19, which means Mr. Lee has 19 baskets of apples.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{19}\\).","ground_truth":"19","predicted_answer":"19","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Specifically, we need to divide 153 by 5.\n\nLet's do the division step-by-step:\n\n1. **Set up the division**: We have 153 pints to divide by 5.\n2. **Divide the first digit**: 1 (the first digit of 153) is less than 5, so we consider the first two digits together, which is 15.\n3. **Divide 15 by 5**: 15 divided by 5 is 3. So, we write 3 above the division bar.\n4. **Multiply and subtract**: Multiply 3 by 5 to get 15, and subtract 15 from 15 to get 0. Bring down the next digit, which is 3.\n5. **Divide the new number**: Now we have 03. 03 divided by 5 is 0. So, we write 0 above the division bar next to the 3.\n6. **Multiply and subtract**: Multiply 0 by 5 to get 0, and subtract 0 from 3 to get 3. This is the remainder.\n\nSo, when we divide 153 by 5, we get a quotient of 30 and a remainder of 3. This means that each glass will have 30 pints, and there will be 3 pints left over. However, since the problem asks for the amount of pints in each glass, we focus on the quotient.\n\nTherefore, the number of pints in each glass is \\(\\boxed{30}\\).","full_output":"To determine how many pints of orange juice would be in each glass when pouring a vat of 153 pints into five glasses with the same amount in each glass, we need to perform a division operation. Specifically, we need to divide 153 by 5.\n\nLet's do the division step-by-step:\n\n1. **Set up the division**: We have 153 pints to divide by 5.\n2. **Divide the first digit**: 1 (the first digit of 153) is less than 5, so we consider the first two digits together, which is 15.\n3. **Divide 15 by 5**: 15 divided by 5 is 3. So, we write 3 above the division bar.\n4. **Multiply and subtract**: Multiply 3 by 5 to get 15, and subtract 15 from 15 to get 0. Bring down the next digit, which is 3.\n5. **Divide the new number**: Now we have 03. 03 divided by 5 is 0. So, we write 0 above the division bar next to the 3.\n6. **Multiply and subtract**: Multiply 0 by 5 to get 0, and subtract 0 from 3 to get 3.

Specifically, we need to divide 201 by 43 and find the quotient.\n\nLet's do the division step-by-step:\n\n1. **Set up the division**: \n   \\[\n   201 \\div 43\n   \\]\n\n2. **Estimate the quotient**: \n   To estimate, we can look at the first two digits of 201, which are 20. Since 20 is less than 43, we consider the whole number 201. We know that:\n   \\[\n   4 \\times 43 = 172 \\quad \\text{(which is less than 201)}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   5 \\times 43 = 215 \\quad \\text{(which is more than 201)}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the quotient must be 4.\n\n3. **Verify the quotient**: \n   To confirm, we multiply 43 by 4:\n   \\[\n   43 \\times 4 = 172\n   \\]\n   Then, we subtract this product from 201 to find the remainder:\n   \\[\n   201 - 172 = 29\n   \\]\n\n4. **Conclusion**: \n   Since the remainder (29) is less than the divisor (43), Adam can make 4 complete piles with 29 pieces of candy left over.\n\nThus, the number of piles Adam can make is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]","ground_truth":"5","predicted_answer":"4","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}
