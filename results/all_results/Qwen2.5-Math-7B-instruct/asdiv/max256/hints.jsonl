Calculate the total number of beads needed for 4 necklaces.\n2. Subtract the total number of beads needed from the total number of beads Robin has.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of beads needed for 4 necklaces:\n\\[ 4 \\text{ necklaces} \\times 31 \\text{ beads per necklace} = 124 \\text{ beads} \\]\n\nSince Robin only has 124 beads, she will have no beads left over after making 4 necklaces. However, if we consider the problem again, it might be a trick question because it's impossible to make 4 necklaces with only 124 beads if each necklace has the same number of beads.
