Specifically, we divide 407 by 11.\n\nLet's do the division step by step:\n\n1. **Set up the division**: We have 407 divided by 11.\n2. **Divide the first digit**: 4 divided by 11 is 0 (since 4 is less than 11). So, we consider the first two digits, which is 40.\n3. **Divide the first two digits**: 40 divided by 11 is 3 (since 11 times 3 is 33, which is the closest multiple of 11 that is less than or equal to 40).
