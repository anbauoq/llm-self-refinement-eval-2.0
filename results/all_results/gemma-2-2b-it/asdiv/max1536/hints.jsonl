The number is 10x + y. Nine times the number is 9(10x + y) = 90x + 9y. The number obtained by reversing the digits is 10y + x. Twice the number is 2(10x + y) = 20x + 2y.

Substituting x = -y/10 into the equation x + y = 9, we get -y/10 + y = 9. Combining terms, we get 9y/10 = 9. Multiplying both sides by 10, we get 9y = 90. Dividing both sides by 9, we get y = 10.
