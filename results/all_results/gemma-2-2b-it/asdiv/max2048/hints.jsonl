Find the number.","chain_of_thought":"Let the tens digit be x and the units digit be y. The number is 10x + y. The sum of the digits is x + y. The product of the digits is xy. The problem states that the number is four times the sum of its digits and twice the product of the digits. So we have the equation: 10x + y = 4(x + y) and 10x + y = 2(xy). We can solve for x and y. From the second equation, we can see that 10x + y = 2xy. We can substitute the value of 10x + y from the first equation into the second equation: 4(x + y) = 2xy. Expanding the left side, we get 4x + 4y = 2xy. Rearranging the terms, we get 2xy - 4x - 4y = 0. We can factor out an x and y to get x(2y - 4) - 4y = 0. We can solve for x in terms of y: x = (4y) / (2y - 4). We can simplify this to x = 2y / (y - 2). We can now substitute this value of x back into the equation 10x + y = 4(x + y): 10 * (2y / (y - 2)) + y = 4( (2y / (y - 2)) + y).

Expanding and simplifying, we get 20y + y^2 - 2y = 8y + 4y^2 - 8y. Combining like terms, we get 0 = 3y^2 - 18y. We can solve for y: y = 0 or y = 6. We can now substitute these values of y back into the equation x = 2y / (y - 2) to find the values of x. If y = 0, then x = 0. If y = 6, then x = 6.

We can simplify this to x = 2y / (y - 2). We can now substitute this value of x back into the equation 10x + y = 4(x + y): 10 * (2y / (y - 2)) + y = 4( (2y / (y - 2)) + y). Simplifying the equation, we get 20y / (y - 2) + y = 8y / (y - 2) + 4y. Multiplying both sides by (y - 2) gives us 20y + y(y - 2) = 8y + 4y(y - 2). Expanding and simplifying, we get 20y + y^2 - 2y = 8y + 4y^2 - 8y. Combining like terms, we get 0 = 3y^2 - 18y. We can solve for y: y = 0 or y = 6. We can now substitute these values of y back into the equation x = 2y / (y - 2) to find the values of x. If y = 0, then x = 0. If y = 6, then x = 6.
