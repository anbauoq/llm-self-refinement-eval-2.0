One-third of the number is x/3. One-fifth is x/5. Eight-fifteenth is 8/15. The problem states: x/3 + x/5 = 8/15. To solve for x, we need to find a common denominator for the fractions on the left side. The common denominator is 15. So, we multiply x/3 by 5/5 and x/5 by 3/3. This gives us (5x/15) + (3x/15) = 8/15. Combining the terms on the left side, we get (8x/15) = 8/15. Then, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides by 15/8: x = 8/15 * 15/8.
