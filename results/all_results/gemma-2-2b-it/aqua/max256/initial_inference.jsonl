Since hose A fills 1/8 of the pool in 2 hours, it fills 1/4 of the pool in 1 hour. Since hose B fills the remaining 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours, it fills 1/3 of the pool in 1 hour.  Combining these, we can set up an equation: (1/4) * 8 + (1/3) * (x * 3) = 1. Simplifying, we get 2 + x = 1. Solving for x, we get x = -1. This doesn't make sense as the hose can't fill the pool in a negative time.  We must have made a mistake.  Let's try a different approach.  Let's say that hose B fills 1/x of the pool in 1 hour.  This means that hose A fills 1/8 of the pool in 1 hour. The combined rate of hose A and hose B is 1/4 + 1/x.  We know that the combined rate is 1/3 of the pool in 3 hours.
