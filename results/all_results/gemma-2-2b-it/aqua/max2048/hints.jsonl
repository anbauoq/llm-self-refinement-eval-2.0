{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n\nOptions:\nA)5(√3 + 1)\nB)6(√3 + √2)\nC)7(√3 – 1)\nD)8(√3 – 2)\nE)None of these","chain_of_thought":"<ans>D</ans>t\nt\nt\nt\nt\nt","full_output":"<think>Let's break down the problem.  The angle of elevation changes as the car moves closer to the base of the tower. We can use trigonometry to understand this. The angle of elevation is the angle between the ground and the line of sight to the top of the tower. The car is moving towards the base of the tower, so the angle of elevation is increasing. We know that the angle of elevation is 45° and 60° when the car is 10 minutes away from the base. We can use the tangent function to find the distance the car has traveled. The tangent of an angle is equal to the opposite side divided by the adjacent side. In this case, the opposite side is the distance to the top of the tower, and the adjacent side is the distance to the car. We can use the tangent function to find the distance to the top of the tower. The tangent of 45° is 1. The tangent of 60° is √3. We can use these values to find the distance to the top of the tower. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance to the base of the tower. The Pythagorean Theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the distance to the base of the tower, and the other two sides are the distance to the top of the tower and the distance to the car. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance to the base of the tower. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the distance to the base of the tower.

We know that x + y + z = 17. We also know that x² + y² + z² = 109.  Let's subtract 495 from the number.  We get: (100x + 10y + z) - 495 = 100z + 10y + x.  Simplifying, we get: 99x + 9y + 99z = 100z + 10y + x.  We can rewrite this as: 99x - x + 9y - 10y + 99z - 100z = 0.  Combining like terms, we get: 98x - y - z = 0.  We can rearrange this as: 98x = y + z.  We can now use the fact that x + y + z = 17 to solve for x, y, and z.  We can substitute 98x for y + z in the equation x + y + z = 17.  We get: x + 98x = 17.

We can now solve for y and z.  We know that y + z = 1698/99.  Substituting y + z = 1698/99, we get: y = 1698/99 - z.  We can now use this value of y to solve for z.  We know that y = 1698/99 - z.
