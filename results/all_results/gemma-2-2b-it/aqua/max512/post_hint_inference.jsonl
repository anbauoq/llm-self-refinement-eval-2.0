{"id":41,"question":"Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?\n\nOptions:\nA)8\nB)15\nC)12\nD)6\nE)3","chain_of_thought":"Let's break down the problem. Since hose A fills the pool alone in 8 hours, its rate is 1/8 of the pool per hour.  Let's say hose B's rate is 'x' per hour.  In the first 2 hours, hose A fills 2/8 = 1/4 of the pool.  Then, together, they fill another 3/3 = 1 of the pool in the next 3 hours. The total time taken for hose A and B to fill the pool together is 2 + 3 = 5 hours. The total amount of work done by hose A and B is equal to 1.  So, the work done by hose B in 5 hours is 1 - (1/4) = 3/4 of the pool. Now, we can set up an equation to find hose B's rate: (1/x) * 5 = 3/4.  Solving for x, we get x = 4/3.  Now, we can find the time it takes hose B to fill the pool alone: 1 / (4/3) = 3/4.  So, it would take hose B 3/4 hours to fill the pool, which is equivalent to 3/4 * 60 = 45 minutes.  Now we need to convert 45 minutes to hours.  Therefore, it would take hose B 45/60 = 0.75 hours, which is equal to 45 minutes.  So, the answer is 0.75 hours or 45 minutes.","full_output":"<think>Let's break down the problem.
