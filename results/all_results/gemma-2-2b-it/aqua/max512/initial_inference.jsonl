We know that the total amount of money earned is $3.40.  This can be written as 0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40.  We don't have enough information to solve for x and y directly.  We need to find a way to express the total number of coins in terms of x.  We can rewrite the equation as 0.20x = 3.40 - 0.25y.  This gives us an equation that can be used to find the minimum number of copper coins.  The minimum number of copper coins is the smallest number that can satisfy the equation 0.20x = 3.40 - 0.25y.  This means that the minimum number of copper coins is 3.40 - 0.25y.  We can solve for y by plugging in the value of x into the equation.  We know that the number of brass coins is y.

We also know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means that when J = F, F = 2(S - F).
