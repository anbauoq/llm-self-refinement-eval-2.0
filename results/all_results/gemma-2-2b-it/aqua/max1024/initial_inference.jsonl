We know that the sine of 45° is 1/√2, and the sine of 60° is √3/2. The distance from the car to the base of the tower is the same at both angles, and we can use the distance formula to solve for the time it takes to reach the base.

Now we can calculate the total number of members: 7x = 7 * (104/7) = 104.

{"id":251,"question":"It takes a worker 9 minutes to drive from home to work at an average rate of 20 kilometers per hour.

We can use the formula distance = rate * time. We know the rate is 20 km/h and the time is 9 minutes. Convert 9 minutes to hours: 9 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.15 hours.  We can now calculate the distance: distance = 20 km/h * 0.15 h = 3 km.  Now, we know the distance to work is 3 km. We need to find the time it takes to cycle that distance at a rate of 6 km/h.  We can use the same formula: time = distance / rate.  So, time = 3 km / 6 km/h = 0.5 hours. Convert to minutes: 0.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 30 minutes.","full_output":"<think>First, we need to find out how far the worker drives to work.  We can use the formula distance = rate * time.
