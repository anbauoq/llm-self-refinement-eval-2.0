Solving the first two equations for F and V, we get F = 1800 - V and F = 2040 - V. Setting the two expressions for F equal to each other, we get 1800 - V = 2040 - V.

For alloy X, the total amount of zinc is (6/15) * 40 = 16 grams, and the total amount of copper is (9/15) * 40 = 24 grams.  For alloy Y, the total amount of zinc is (7/18) * 60 = 22.22 grams, and the total amount of copper is (11/18) * 60 = 38.89 grams.  We can find the total amount of zinc and copper in alloy Z by adding the amounts of zinc and copper from each alloy.  The total amount of zinc in alloy Z is 16 + 22.22 = 38.22 grams, and the total amount of copper in alloy Z is 24 + 38.89 = 62.89 grams.  We can then find the ratio of zinc and copper in alloy Z by dividing the amount of zinc in alloy Z by the amount of copper in alloy Z.  The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 38.22/62.89 = 0.61.  We can then multiply by 100 to get a percentage.  The percentage is 0.61 * 100 = 61%.  We can then convert the percentage to a ratio.  The ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z is 61:100, which simplifies to 61:100.  This is the ratio of zinc to copper in alloy Z. </think>\n<ans>D</ans>","ground_truth":"B","predicted_answer":"D","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

The other root can be found using the quadratic formula: x = (-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.  In this case, a = 1, b = m, and c = 22.  We know that (x - 1.5) is a factor, so when we multiply this by (x - 1.5) we get 0.  This means that 1.5 is a root of the equation.  Solving for m, we get: x = 1.5.

The problem states that the costs of the items do not change. We need to make sure our answer does not violate this condition.  We can solve the original equations for x and y. We can rewrite the equation 1x + 2y = 0.15 as x = 0.15 - 2y. Substituting this into the equation 2x + 3y = 0.3 gives 2(0.15 - 2y) + 3y = 0.3. This simplifies to 0.3 - 4y + 3y = 0.3. This simplifies to -y = 0, so y = 0. Substituting this back into the equation x = 0.15 - 2y gives x = 0.15 - 2(0) = 0.15. So, the cost of six sodas and seven bars is 6(0.15) + 7(0.15) = 0.9 + 1.05 = 1.95.  This is not one of the answer choices. The problem states that the costs of the items do not change.
