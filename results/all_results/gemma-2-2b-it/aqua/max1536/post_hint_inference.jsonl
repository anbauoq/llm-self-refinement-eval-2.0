{"id":91,"question":"The telephone bill of a certain establishment is party fixed and partly varies as the number of calls consumed. When in a certain month 540 calls made the bill is Rs.1800.

The bill for that month would be :\n\nOptions:\nA)Rs.1560\nB)Rs.1680\nC)Rs.1840\nD)Rs.1950\nE)Rs.1690","chain_of_thought":"We can represent the bill as a linear function of the number of calls.  Let the number of calls be x and the bill be y.  We can write the bill as y = mx + c.  We can use the given information to find the slope m and the y-intercept c.  For example, when 540 calls are made, the bill is Rs. 1800.  This means that y = 1800 when x = 540.  Substituting this into the equation y = mx + c, we get 1800 = 5m * 540 + c.  Similarly, when 620 calls are made, the bill is Rs. 2040.  Substituting this into the equation y = mx + c, we get 2040 = 5m * 620 + c.  Solving this system of equations, we can find the slope m and the y-intercept c.  The slope m is the change in bill divided by the change in calls, which is (2040 - 1800) / (620 - 540) = 240 / 80 = 3.  The y-intercept c is the bill when the number of calls is 0, which is 1800 - 3 * 540 = 1800 - 1620 = 180.  Therefore, the bill can be represented by the equation y = 3x + 180.

We know the area of the yard is L * B = 240. We also know that the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 * (L + B). We are told that one side of the yard is unfenced, so L = 10. We can substitute this value into the area equation to get B = 240/L = 240/10 = 24. We can now use this value of B to find the perimeter of the rectangle: 2 * (10 + 24) = 62 meters of fencing.</think>\n<ans>B</ans>","ground_truth":"A","predicted_answer":"B","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

Let the three consecutive integers be x, x+1, and x+2. The product of these numbers is x(x+1)(x+2). We need to find the values of x that make this product equal to 727+728+729.  Notice that 727+728+729 is divisible by 3.  The factors of 727+728+729 are 1, 3, 9, 81, and 243. The product of three consecutive integers is 243.  The product of three consecutive integers is 243, and the sum of three consecutive integers is 37.
