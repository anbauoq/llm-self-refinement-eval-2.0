{"id":252,"question":"Two friends are eating a jar full of candies. Had P eaten alone, it would have taken him 10 minutes to finish the candies in the jar. Had Q eaten alone, it would have taken her 5 minutes to finish half the jar. Since both of them are eating simultaneously, how many minutes would it take them to empty the jar?\n\nOptions:\nA)4\nB)5\nC)6\nD)7\nE)8","chain_of_thought":"Let's figure out how many candies each person eats in one minute. P eats 10 minutes to eat the whole jar, so he eats 1/10 of the jar per minute. Q eats half the jar in 5 minutes, so she eats 1/5 of the jar per minute. Since they are eating simultaneously, we need to find a common denominator to combine their rates. 10/10 and 5/5 are the common denominators. If we combine their rates, we get 1/10 + 1/5 = 3/10. So, together, they eat 3/10 of the jar per minute.","full_output":"<think>Let's figure out how many candies each person eats in one minute.
