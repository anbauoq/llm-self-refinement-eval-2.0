{"id":12,"question":"Is the following sentence plausible? Wayne Rooney shot from outside the eighteen","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out if the sentence \"Wayne Rooney shot from outside the eighteen\" is plausible. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Wayne Rooney is a well-known English footballer, specifically a striker who plays for Manchester United. He's known for his goal-scoring skills and is one of the most decorated players in football history. So, he's definitely a professional, which makes the sentence contextually relevant.\n\nNext, the phrase \"from outside the eighteen\" is a bit tricky. \"From outside the eighteen\" typically means something happened outside the age of 18, which is in the late 1800s or early 1900s. But Wayne Rooney was born in 1975, so he was outside the eighteen in 1975. However, the phrase \"from outside the eighteen\" is more commonly used in a metaphorical sense, often to refer to something significant that happened in the 1900s or 1910s, like a major event or a notable achievement.\n\nWayne Rooney didn't score goals as frequently as other stars of his era. He was known for his goal-scoring ability, but he didn't have the same level of impact as, say, Michael Jordan or Michael Spence. His career was marked by multiple World Cups and a lot of highs and lows. However, his goal-scoring ability was consistent enough that \"from outside the eighteen\" might seem plausible in a way, even though the phrase is generally used metaphorically.\n\nAnother angle is that \"from outside the eighteen\" could be a playful way to refer to his age, making the sentence seem a bit more personal and funny. But in a strict sense, it's not a standard phrase and might be considered incorrect usage.\n\nSo, considering all this, the sentence is plausible in a metaphorical or playful sense, but it's not a standard way to refer to Wayne Rooney's age. However, since the question is about plausibility, and the phrase can be used in a humorous way, it might still be considered plausible.\n\nBut wait, I'm not entirely sure if \"from outside the eighteen\" is commonly used in that way. Maybe it's more about the metaphor than the actual age. If I think about it, the phrase is often used to refer to significant events or achievements that happened in the 1900s, so in that context, it could be plausible as a way to refer to a specific age. However, Wayne Rooney's age is 1975, which is way outside the 18th century, so the metaphor might not hold.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is plausible in a metaphorical sense but not in a literal sense.

Darcy Kuemper scored on the power play","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let's break down the question step by step to determine if the sentence \"Darcy Kuemper scored on the power play\" is plausible.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each term means. Darcy Kuemper is a player, but I don't recall if he's known for scoring on the power play. The power play is a defensive situation in ice hockey where teams defend a puck that's been passed to a certain player, allowing them to score from behind.\n\nNext, I should consider if Kuemper has had a chance to score on the power play. Power play scoring is a relatively rare achievement, and it's not uncommon for top-tier players to score on it. However, it's also not guaranteed, especially in high-pressure situations.\n\nI should also think about the context in which the power play is used. In ice hockey, the power play is typically used by a team's center to score from behind. For a player to score on the power play, they would need to be the one initiating the play and scoring from behind. Darcy Kuemper, as a player, might not have the necessary skills to consistently score on the power play.\n\nAdditionally, the sentence doesn't provide any context about the game or the team's strategy. It's a general statement without specific details, making it harder to assess the likelihood.\n\nConsidering all these factors, while Darcy Kuemper may have had the opportunity to score on the power play, it's not a common occurrence.

{"id":41,"question":"Is the following sentence plausible? Paul Goldschmidt walked on ball four","chain_of_thought":"Alright, so I need to determine if the sentence \"Paul Goldschmidt walked on ball four\" is plausible in a real-world sports setting. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify who Paul Goldschmidt is. He's a well-known American football player, specifically known for his role as a tight end for the New York Giants. He's also a former player for the Dallas Cowboys. So, he's definitely a football player.\n\nNext, I need to understand what \"walked on ball four\" means. In sports, when someone says \"walked on ball four,\" it typically refers to being in a good position to make a shot or tackle. It's a phrase used in football to indicate that the offensive team is in a good spot to score or block. So, \"walked on ball four\" in the context of football would mean the offensive team is in a good position to score.\n\nNow, considering Goldschmidt as a football player, his skill level and playing style would play a significant role in whether he would be in a good position to score. In football, players need to be in the right position to make a successful play. However, there are still some defensive players who can be in good positions, especially if they're well-positioned on the field.\n\nI also need to think about the timeline. If we're talking about a recent game, the situation might have changed. For example, if Goldschmidt is a top-tier quarterback, he might be in a good position to throw the ball to a receiver. But if he's a weaker quarterback, it might be more challenging.\n\nAdditionally, the defensive line's performance is crucial. If the defensive line is strong and positioned well, Goldschmidt might be in a good spot. However, if the defense isn't as strong, he might not be in a good position.\n\nThere's also the concept of \"offensive pressure.\" If the offensive line is under pressure, a weak quarterback might be in a less favorable position. Conversely, a strong line would position him well.\n\nAnother angle is the skill level of the quarterback. If Goldschmidt is a skilled tight end, he might have the ability to make a good play from behind, which would be indicated by being in a good position.\n\nI should also consider that \"walked on ball four\" is a phrase used in football, so it's more about the offensive team's ability to score rather than Goldschmidt's skills. However, it's still relevant because it's a common phrase indicating a favorable offensive position.\n\nIn summary, while it's possible for a football player like Paul Goldschmidt to be in a good position to score, it's not guaranteed. The outcome depends on the offensive line's strength, the quarterback's skill, and the defensive line's positioning.

So, the person in question is a professional soccer player.\n\nNext, the phrase \"double stepover.\" I'm not familiar with this term, but I know that in sports, especially soccer, players often refer to specific movements or actions.

If it's not a recognized term, then the sentence might not make sense.\n\nI also need to consider the context in which this sentence is used.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Calvin Ridley is a well-known figure in the NFL, especially as a quarterback. He's been in the game for a while, so he's established. The NFC divisional round is a critical part of the NFL playoffs, where the top teams from the NFC compete for a spot in the championship game.\n\nNow, running out of bounds in the NFC divisional round seems a bit odd. I mean, the NFL rules are pretty strict about safety, so running out of bounds would be a serious violation. However, I should consider if Calvin Ridley has ever been involved in any serious incidents in the NFL. \n\nI know that players can be involved in various situations, but running out of bounds in a major league game is extremely rare. It's not something I've heard of in my professional experience. Even if it happened, it would be a major event that would likely be reported and could be a reason to disqualify a player, but not a reason to call them out of bounds in a playoff round.\n\nAdditionally, in the NFL, if a player is involved in a safety violation, they're usually suspended for a few games or even more severe penalties. But in a playoff round, the rules are much looser, and such a violation wouldn't be a common occurrence.\n\nSo, putting this together, while it's a serious issue, it's not something Calvin Ridley would be called out of bounds for in the NFC divisional round.

So, in the context of basketball, a three-pointer is when a player attempts a shot from beyond the three-point line and makes it.\n\nNow, looking at the sentence, it's talking about Nathan MacKinnon attempting a three-pointer in the Eastern Conference Finals of the NBA. The finals of the NBA are typically in the Eastern Time Zone, so the time is probably in the morning or early afternoon.\n\nI should check if there was any significant event or game in the Eastern Conference Finals where Nathan MacKinnon attempted a three-pointer. From what I remember, the 2021-2022 NBA Finals were held in the Eastern Conference, and one of the teams was the Golden State Warriors.

So, in basketball, players might make a shot just before the game ends to score, which is a common practice.\n\nNow, Tyler Boyd is a known professional basketball player, specifically a point guard for the Dallas Cowboys. He's a consistent and reliable player. So, if Tyler Boyd were to airballed a shot, that would mean he made the shot just before the game ended. That seems plausible because in basketball, making a shot before the clock is a normal and expected behavior, especially during high-pressure situations.\n\nHowever, I should consider if there are any biases or if this is a common occurrence.

So, \"Anders Lee\" is a hockey player, and if he's in a restricted area, that makes sense because that's how it usually happens.\n\nNext, I should consider the context. In hockey, when a player is restricted, it's often because they've been given a spot by the coach or a manager. The coach might assign a player to a restricted area to prevent them from being on the ice or to give them a specific role. So, \"Anders Lee drove into the restricted area\" sounds reasonable because it fits the typical sports scenario where a player is given a spot.\n\nI don't think there's any reason this wouldn't happen.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Thomas Muller is a football player, specifically a goalkeeper for Manchester United. He's been on the scene recently. Now, the phrase \"get on the end of a through ball\" is a term used in football, but I'm not exactly sure how it's used. I think it's a bit uncommon, but I've heard it in some contexts.\n\nI recall that in football, a \"through ball\" is a penalty kick, right? It's when the goalkeeper takes the penalty, so the team that took the penalty would get a point. So, \"getting on the end of a through ball\" would mean that Thomas Muller prevented a penalty kick, which is possible.\n\nBut I'm not sure if it's a very common phrase. I think it's more of a casual or less formal term. Maybe it's used in casual conversations or among friends. I should check if there's a more common way to refer to a penalty kick. I don't think so; it's pretty specific.\n\nI also wonder if there's a more standard term for this. Maybe \"penalty kick\" is more common, but the phrase \"get on the end of a through ball\" seems specific.

Luka Doncic  committed a three second violation","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Luka Doncic committed a three-second violation\" is plausible. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what a three-second violation means. In sports, especially in basketball, a three-second violation typically refers to a player committing a foul that would result in a free throw or a two-point conversion. For example, if a player makes a three-pointer and then fouls themselves, it's a three-second violation. This is a common play in basketball, so it's not something that would be uncommon.\n\nNext, I should consider who Luka Doncic is. He's a professional basketball player, known for his skills and experience. He's been playing for a while and has a good reputation in the game. Given his proven ability to commit such a violation, it's reasonable to think that this statement is plausible.\n\nI also need to think about the context. In a real-world scenario, basketball players are often involved in such high-stakes situations, especially during games where fouls can happen. Therefore, the idea that Doncic, a well-known player, would commit a three-second violation is something that could happen, although it's not something that happens every day.\n\nAnother angle is to consider the frequency of such events. In a game, a player committing a three-second violation is a specific occurrence that can happen, but it's not something that would be typical for every game. However, since the question is about the plausibility of the sentence, not whether it's a common occurrence, it still holds.\n\nI should also think about any biases or assumptions. I don't have any biases, so I'm basing this on general knowledge of basketball and the experiences of players like Doncic. There's no evidence to suggest that he would do this, but it's still plausible because it's a common occurrence in the game.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the phrasing. The sentence is concise and directly refers to a specific event, which makes it easier to assess its plausibility. There's no ambiguity in the meaning, which helps in evaluating whether the statement holds up.\n\nIn summary, considering all these factors—Doncic's status as a professional basketball player, the nature of a three-second violation, and the context of a game—this sentence is plausible.

So, if Javi was a quarterback, this makes sense because he can intercept passes, complete them, and turn them over.\n\nBut wait, the question is about a football game, so I need to ensure that the context is correct. In football, a turnover is when a receiver catches the ball after a quarterback throws it, so the receiver intercepts it, completes the pass, and then turns it over. That's exactly what \"nutmegged\" means in this context.\n\nHowever, the sentence doesn't specify the scenario beyond the general context of a football game. It doesn't mention any specific play or event, just that the quarterback nutmegged the defender. That seems a bit vague. It might be implying that the quarterback successfully completed a pass and turned it over, which is a common scenario in football.\n\nBut is \"nutmegged\" a term that's used in football? I think it's more commonly used in other sports like football. In football, the term \"turnover\" is standard, and \"nutmegged\" might not be a term that's commonly used in football. It might be more of a term used in other sports like basketball or other sports where players are involved in turnover plays.\n\nSo, considering that, \"nutmegged\" might not be the correct term in the context of a football game.

The word \"beat the buzzer\" is a phrase that means he scored just before the game ended, or he shot clocked out before the timeout.\n\nNow, I'm wondering if this is realistic.

That makes this sentence implausible because it's impossible for a player to have played in a divisional round of the AFC, which is part of the NFL. \n\nTherefore, the sentence is not plausible. The final answer should reflect that.","full_output":"Okay, so I need to determine if the sentence \"Trevor Story hit the wheel route in the AFC divisional round\" is plausible. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"hit the wheel route\" means. In sports terminology, \"wheel route\" typically refers to a specific play in football. The term \"wheel route\" is commonly used in football to describe a play where a team's offensive line is set up to block a passing run. So, \"hit the wheel route\" likely refers to a successful wheel route play.\n\nNext, I need to consider Trevor Story. I know that Trevor Story is a professional American football quarterback. He's known for his performance in the NFL, where he has been a key player in many games and seasons. His career has been successful, and he's had multiple successful plays, including successful wheel route plays.\n\nNow, the question is about whether Trevor Story could have hit the wheel route in the AFC divisional round. The AFC (American Football Conference) is a major conference in the NFL. Divisional rounds are a crucial part of the NFL playoffs, where teams compete for a spot in the Super Bowl. They are highly competitive and involve intense gameplay.\n\nTrevor Story, as a quarterback, would have been playing in the NFL, and his performance in any given season is highly competitive. Achieving a \"wheel route\" in the AFC divisional round would require him to be in that position, which is a significant achievement in the game. However, in reality, it's extremely unlikely for a single quarterback to hit the wheel route in the divisional round because it requires both skill and consistency, both of which are challenging to achieve in a high-stakes football game.\n\nAdditionally, the AFC divisional round is a major event with a lot of pressure. There are multiple plays and plays against strong opponents, making it extremely difficult for any team, including a top-tier quarterback, to consistently achieve a \"wheel route\" in such a setting.\n\nTherefore, considering all this, it's plausible that Trevor Story could have hit the wheel route in the AFC divisional round, but it's extremely unlikely. However, given that he's a top-tier quarterback, it's not impossible. But it's more realistic to think that he might have achieved this in a successful season rather than a single divisional round game.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sentence is plausible but not certain, and it's a challenging achievement for a top-tier quarterback to achieve in a single divisional round game.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence \"Trevor Story hit the wheel route in the AFC divisional round\" is plausible but not certain, as it's an extremely challenging achievement for a top-tier quarterback to achieve in a single divisional round game.\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Trevor Story hit the wheel route in the AFC divisional round\" is plausible.

An indirect kick in football typically refers to a penalty where the ball is kicked off-center, leading to a loss of possession. This is a common occurrence in football matches, especially in the FA Cup, which is a high-level competition.\n\nI recall that Mark Stone was involved in many FA Cup matches. In fact, he was part of the squad that won the FA Cup in 1997, which was a significant event in football history. During that match, Stone was involved in a penalty after an off-center kick. So, it's plausible that he was involved in such a penalty in the 1997 FA Cup match.\n\nPutting it all together, Mark Stone being a prominent football manager and having been involved in a penalty in the FA Cup makes the sentence plausible.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{1}","ground_truth":"0","predicted_answer":"1","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

So, he's not a player who would be making this kind of play in a football game.\n\nNext, the phrase \"went for it on fourth down\" is common in American football. It means the player attempted to gain four yards on a fourth-and-long, which is a specific play in the football offense. However, Sabonis isn't a professional football player, so he wouldn't be attempting this play in a real football game.\n\nThen, the part \"in the NFC divisional round\" refers to the National Football League's playoffs. The NFC divisional round is the final stage of the regular season playoffs, where the top two teams from each conference compete for a spot in the championship game. Sabonis isn't even a team, he's a player.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence is mixing football terminology with a non-existent football player. It's impossible for a non-pro athlete to be in a football game, let alone attempting a fourth-and-long play. This seems overly dramatic and unrealistic.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the sentence is not plausible because Domantas Sabonis isn't a professional football player, and the scenario described doesn't make sense in the context of football.","full_output":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Domantas Sabonis went for it on fourth down in the NFC divisional round\" is plausible.

I can't recall any major instances, but it's possible in theory. Maybe in a game where Carlson was on a poor day, or he made a poor decision, he could have fumbled the ball.\n\nI should also consider if this is a realistic scenario. Football players are known for their skill and responsibility, so a fumble would be unusual but not impossible. It might be more common in weaker opponents or in less experienced teams.\n\nAdditionally, I should think about the rules of the game. Fumbling the ball is a legal and expected action in football, so it's not something that would be ruled out by the rules.

The Eastern Conference in the NFL is a top-tier division, and it's a significant part of the schedule. Since Radamel has been with the Giants for a long time, it's plausible that he had an exceptional performance in a major conference final.\n\nI should also consider the context of the football team's performance. The Giants have been strong in the conference, and having a quarterback who's had a successful season is a positive indicator. It's not uncommon for quarterbacks to have standout performances, especially in key games like finals.\n\nPutting it all together, Radamel Falcao is a real player with a strong career in the NFL, and it's plausible that he had an airballed shot in the Eastern Conference Finals.

While turnover is a plausible penalty for a player, it's less common in football compared to other sports like soccer or basketball. Additionally, the sentence doesn't specify whether it's a turnover or another type of penalty, which could make it less specific.\n\nI also need to think about the likelihood of a football player being called for a turnover. In reality, players can be called for various penalties, but a turnover is less frequent. It's a possible scenario, but not the most common one.\n\nConsidering all factors, the sentence is plausible but not the most typical or frequent occurrence of a turnover in football. It's a reasonable statement, but it's not as common as other penalties. Therefore, I will consider it plausible but not the most typical case.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{1}","ground_truth":"0","predicted_answer":"1","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

She's known for her exceptional shooting skills and is often called the \"Maverick Player\" because of her performance. I remember hearing that she's known for making baskets, especially from the court, and sometimes even from the bench in games.\n\nSo, if someone says she performed a give and go, it's referring to her making a basket or a play just before the clock expired. That makes sense because in basketball, that's a common phrase. So the sentence is plausible because it's a typical way to refer to her performance.\n\nWait, but I should double-check if there's any context where \"give and go\" is used differently. In other sports, like football, \"give and go\" isn't a standard phrase.

He's known for his plays in football, which include things like passes, runs, and completions. So \"caught the screen pass\" is a specific term that's usually used in football, not in sports like basketball or ice hockey.\n\nIn football, a \"screen pass\" is a play where the quarterback throws a pass to a teammate who is running away, which is then intercepted and returned by the opposing team. The term \"screen pass\" is specific to football. On the other hand, the phrase \"catch the screen pass\" is a slang term used in basketball, referring to making a basket before the game clock runs out. It's not a term that would be used in football.\n\nAdditionally, Josh Allen is a known quarterback, so he wouldn't be described as catching a screen pass.

However, Terry McLaurin is a football player, not a basketball player, so his involvement in a basketball game is unexpected.\n\nI also need to think about how unlikely this situation is. Since McLaurin is a football player, it's improbable that he would be involved in a basketball game or even the NBA playoffs. Therefore, the idea of him committing a blocking foul in that context seems highly implausible.\n\nAdditionally, football and basketball are distinct sports, and the terms used in the question (like a blocking foul in a basketball context) don't align with football terminology. This makes the scenario seem inconsistent with real-world sports.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the scenario is not plausible because it's mixing football and basketball, which are unrelated sports, and the specific action mentioned (blocking a foul) is a basketball term that doesn't fit a football player's context in a NBA game.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{0}","ground_truth":"0","predicted_answer":"0","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

{"id":295,"question":"Is the following sentence plausible? Travis Konecny did a maradona on the defender","chain_of_thought":"Alright, let's tackle this step by step. The question is whether Travis Konecny did a \"Maranda\" on the defender. First, I need to understand what \"Maranda\" refers to. It's a term that's a bit tricky. I think it's a misspelling of \"Marceau,\" which is a French term used in sports to describe a defensive play where the defender catches the ball before the offensive team can score. \n\nTravis Konecny is a professional American football quarterback. So, is he considered a \"Maranda\"? Well, in football, a Maranda would involve the quarterback catching the ball, which is a common play. However, the term \"Maranda\" is more commonly associated with baseball, where it refers to a defensive play where the pitcher catches the ball. \n\nIn the context of football, \"Maranda\" isn't a standard term, and it's more about the quarterback catching the ball. So, the idea that Travis Konecny did a Maranda on the defender is a bit off because it's mixing a football term with a baseball term. Additionally, the phrase \"did a Maranda on the defender\" sounds a bit odd and not commonly used in football. \n\nTherefore, while the term \"Maranda\" is valid in some contexts, in football, it's not a standard phrase. So, the statement might not be entirely plausible because it's mixing terminology from different sports in a way that's not commonly understood. However, it could be plausible if the context is adjusted to refer to the quarterback catching the ball, which is a common play in football. \n\nBut considering the original phrasing, it's a bit unclear and might not be the most accurate or natural way to describe a football play.

The question is whether Travis Konecny did a \"Maranda\" on the defender. First, I need to understand what \"Maranda\" refers to. It's a term that's a bit tricky. I think it's a misspelling of \"Marceau,\" which is a French term used in sports to describe a defensive play where the defender catches the ball before the offensive team can score. \n\nTravis Konecny is a professional American football quarterback. So, is he considered a \"Maranda\"? Well, in football, a Maranda would involve the quarterback catching the ball, which is a common play. However, the term \"Maranda\" is more commonly associated with baseball, where it refers to a defensive play where the pitcher catches the ball. \n\nIn the context of football, \"Maranda\" isn't a standard term, and it's more about the quarterback catching the ball. So, the idea that Travis Konecny did a Maranda on the defender is a bit off because it's mixing a football term with a baseball term. Additionally, the phrase \"did a Maranda on the defender\" sounds a bit odd and not commonly used in football. \n\nTherefore, while the term \"Maranda\" is valid in some contexts, in football, it's not a standard phrase.

The sentence is, \"Max Scherzer converted the first down.\" I need to determine if this is plausible in a real-world sports context, specifically in football.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Max Scherzer is known for. He's a legendary quarterback for the Green Bay Packers. He's famous for his speed and accuracy. \n\nNext, I need to understand what \"converted the first down\" means in football. In football, when a team fails to get a first down, the team can attempt to convert it by throwing the ball to their own end zone or to a team's end zone. A conversion attempt is usually attempted by the opposing team.\n\nSo, if the sentence says Max Scherzer converted the first down, it would mean that the Packers, after a failed first down, threw the ball to the opposing team's end zone. \n\nIs this plausible? Well, in reality, there have been instances where teams have attempted to convert a failed first down. For example, in 2016, the Green Bay Packers attempted to convert a failed first down on their own team's own end zone, which was successful. However, these attempts are usually unsuccessful because teams are typically faster and more accurate than the opposing team's defense. \n\nTherefore, while it's possible for teams to attempt to convert a failed first down, it's not very common, and such attempts are usually unsuccessful.

It's not something that would be casually referred to as a \"three second violation\" in the context of a game.\n\nSo, putting it together, while the term \"three second violation\" is correct in football, the sentence itself doesn't seem plausible because it implies a casual or unintentional mistake in a professional game, which is unlikely.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that this sentence is not plausible.\n</think>\n\nThe sentence is not plausible.\n\n\\boxed{0}","ground_truth":"1","predicted_answer":"0","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

He played as a running back for the Canadian Football League (CFL) for a few years. Now, he's transitioning into professional football in the United States.\n\nNext, I need to understand what it means to \"spend time in the penalty box.\" In football, the penalty box is where teams must defend their own own goals if they score, and it's a critical area for players to maintain their position. The act of spending time in the penalty box would imply that the player was actively participating or maintaining their position in that specific area during a game.\n\nNow, considering Nugent-Hopkins' role as a CFL player, I should think about how he would perform in the penalty box. CFL players are primarily focused on defense, and their roles are more about stopping opponents' attacks rather than actively maintaining their own positions. While they might have to be in the penalty box to defend their own goals, they are not typically known for spending significant time there as defenders.\n\nAdditionally, the transition from CFL to professional football might have introduced Nugent-Hopkins to the penalty box more frequently. However, in the NFL, players are expected to be active, defensive, and maintain their positions to prevent the opposing team from scoring. They should not spend too much time in the penalty box because it's meant for defending.\n\nPutting this together, it seems unlikely that Nugent-Hopkins would spend significant time in the penalty box in a real-world setting.

He's a forward for the New England Patriots. So he's definitely a football player.\n\nNext, I need to understand what \"added time\" means in the context of football. In college basketball, a \"perfect from the line\" is a phrase meaning making all free throws. Similarly, in football, a \"perfect pass\" is when a player throws a pass without any bounce, which is a very specific and rare action.\n\nNow, looking at the sentence: \"Bastian Schweinsteiger scored in added time.\" So he scored in the extra time of a game. In college basketball, a \"perfect from the line\" is a significant event because it's so specific. In football, scoring in extra time is also rare because extra time is typically 15 seconds, and it's unlikely for a player to score in that time unless they have a very good game.\n\nAlso, I should consider the likelihood of a football player scoring in extra time. In college football, extra time is usually 15 seconds, and players usually score within the first 20 minutes. Scoring in extra time would be unusual and almost impossible.\n\nAnother point is that in college basketball, a \"perfect from the line\" is a significant achievement because it requires precise throws and defensive stops.

Let me break this down.\n\nPatrik Laine is a professional hockey player, specifically known for his role as the captain of the Edmonton Oilers. In hockey, players often skate forward, especially in power play situations where they're actively moving forward for goals or assists. However, there are moments where players might skate backward, such as in defensive situations or when holding the puck behind their body.\n\nBut the term \"skated backwards\" in the sentence is a bit unusual. In hockey, it's more common to refer to players moving forward, not backward. Even in power play, players typically skate forward, but the phrase \"skated backwards\" might be used more metaphorically or in a specific context, though it's not a standard or common phrase.\n\nConsidering the context, it's plausible that a player might skate backward in a specific scenario, but it's not a typical or conventional way to refer to their movement. It's more of a playful or humorous term rather than a standard expression.\n\nTherefore, while it's possible in a non-standard context, it's not extremely unlikely or inconsistent with real-world sports.

Jimmy Garoppolo, being a good quarterback, would have a good chance of fumbling the ball, especially if he's in control of the ball.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should check if Jerry Jeudy is a known player. I recall that Jerry Jeudy was a goal-scoring center in the NHL. I think he was a young player, maybe in his early 20s or early 30s.\n\nNext, I need to consider what the \"power play\" entails. The power play is a defensive defensive role for teams, where the defense can't score and the offense is allowed to score. It's a high-stakes area for teams to dominate.\n\nNow, I should think about whether a goal scored by a young player like Jeudy on the power play is plausible. Power play goals can be frequent, especially in games that go over the 60-minute mark. Also, young players have the potential to score on the power play, especially in high-pressure situations.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the context. The power play is a part of the game, and it's not uncommon for players to score on it, especially if the opposing team is struggling. Jeudy's scoring ability on the power play could be a sign of his skill and defensive capabilities.\n\nConsidering all these points, it seems plausible for Jerry Jeudy to score on the power play in a real-world game. However, I should also think about the likelihood. Power play goals can occur multiple times in a game, and young players often have the opportunity to score on it.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should check if Jerry Jeudy is a known player. I recall that Jerry Jeudy was a goal-scoring center in the NHL. I think he was a young player, maybe in his early 20s or early 30s.\n\nNext, I need to consider what the \"power play\" entails. The power play is a defensive defensive role for teams, where the defense can't score and the offense is allowed to score. It's a high-stakes area for teams to dominate.\n\nNow, I should think about whether a goal scored by a young player like Jeudy on the power play is plausible. Power play goals can be frequent, especially in games that go over the 60-minute mark. Also, young players have the potential to score on the power play, especially in high-pressure situations.\n\nAdditionally, I should consider the context. The power play is a part of the game, and it's not uncommon for players to score on it, especially if the opposing team is struggling. Jeudy's scoring ability on the power play could be a sign of his skill and defensive capabilities.\n\nConsidering all these points, it seems plausible for Jerry Jeudy to score on the power play in a real-world game. However, I should also think about the likelihood. Power play goals can occur multiple times in a game, and young players often have the opportunity to score on it. There's no reason why this wouldn't happen.\n\nI don't see any inconsistencies or implausibilities here. The scenario fits within the realm of sports and the capabilities of a young player on the power play.

Marcus Smart is a professional football quarterback, right? He's known for his performance on the field. Now, a \"heat check\" is a term used in sports, specifically in American football, to indicate that the quarterback has checked the line for safety before throwing the ball. So, when someone takes a heat check, they're ensuring that the receiver is within the line of sight, which is a common practice in football.\n\nThe sentence says Marcus Smart took a heat check three times. That seems a bit odd. Typically, a quarterback doesn't take a heat check three times in a single game. Usually, they might take it once or twice, but three times sounds like a mistake or a typo. Maybe the person who wrote the question meant to say he took a heat check twice, or perhaps it's a mistake in the wording. Given that, the sentence doesn't seem plausible because it's unlikely that a professional quarterback would take a heat check three times in a game.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sentence is not plausible because it's an unusual and incorrect use of the term \"heat check\" in the context of a football game.","full_output":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Marcus Smart took a heat check three\" is plausible.

The question is whether Stefon Diggs, a professional football player, hitting a \"slant pass\" is plausible. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what a \"slant pass\" means in football. From what I know, in football, a slant pass is a play where the quarterback throws the ball to a receiver who is not directly in front of them but slightly behind, creating a slant. This is a common play in American football, so it's not something that should be used in a less professional sport like ice hockey.\n\nNext, I should consider the context.

Jonas Valanciunas comitted an offensive foul","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Jonas Valanciunas committed an offensive foul\" is plausible in a real-world sports setting, specifically football. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what Jonas Valanciunas is known for. He's a professional American football quarterback. He's been with the Green Bay Packers for a while and is one of the team's most successful players. His career has been marked by several notable achievements, including multiple Super Bowl wins and a few other significant plays.\n\nNow, the sentence in question is about him committing an offensive foul. I know that in football, an offensive foul is a play that causes an offensive team to lose possession of the ball. This is different from a defensive foul, which is a defensive play. offensive fulos are more about physical play and are a common occurrence in football, especially in games where the defense is struggling.\n\nI should also think about whether Jonas Valanciunas is known for committing offensive fulos. From what I remember, he's been involved in several fulos in his career, both on the field and in games. For example, in the 2013 season, he was involved in a play that led to a fulo. However, I'm not sure if he's been known for committing offensive fulos consistently. It might be more common for him to have a variety of plays, including both offensive and defensive.\n\nAnother point to consider is the context of the sentence. The sentence doesn't specify when or where it happened, but it's asking if it's plausible in general. Since he's a professional athlete, he's likely to engage in any type of play, offensive or defensive, on a regular basis. Therefore, committing an offensive foul is a plausible behavior in a football game.\n\nAdditionally, the act of committing an offensive foul is a natural part of football play. It's not something that's inherently impossible or unusual for a player to do. It's more about the strategy and execution of the game rather than a specific skill or talent.\n\nPutting it all together, Jonas Valanciunas's career includes a variety of plays, and committing an offensive foul is a normal occurrence in football.

So, he's a key player in baseball, not football. That's an important point because the question mentions football, but the player in question is actually a baseball pitcher.\n\nNext, the phrase \"throw to first base.\" In baseball, when a pitcher throws, they typically throw the ball to a designated catchers' box. For first base, the catchers usually stand behind first base, so the pitcher throws to first base. That makes sense because first base is a common target for pitchers.\n\nBut wait, the question is about football. So, if I'm looking at a football game, does the same thing happen? In football, the quarterback throws the ball to a receiver, not to a base like first base. So, in a football game, a player wouldn't be throwing to first base.

He's known for his performance in games, so running out of bounds would imply he was running past the opposing team's end zone or beyond the goal posts.\n\nI should consider whether this is a common occurrence in football. In football, players are usually within their own lines of play unless there's a special play like a fumble recovery. Calculating the distance he ran would depend on the game situation. If he was running through the end zone, it's possible, but it's not common. If he was running beyond the goal posts, that's less likely because the goal posts are 10 yards apart, and players can cover that easily.\n\nAdditionally, in reality, players often make mistakes like running out of bounds or missing the end zone, but these are usually minor and not the most significant plays. Therefore, the statement \"Calvin Ridley ran out of bounds\" is plausible in a real-world football game.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{1}","ground_truth":"1","predicted_answer":"1","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}
{"id":407,"question":"Is the following sentence plausible? Carlos Tevez skated backwards","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Carlos Tevez skated backwards\" is plausible in a real-world sports setting. Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify who Carlos Tevez is. He's a professional hockey player, specifically known for his skating skills. I remember he's a forward in the National Hockey League (NHL). So, if the question is about him skating backwards, I need to consider whether that's a realistic or common occurrence in his career.\n\nNext, I should think about the context. In sports, players often use the puck or other equipment. In hockey, the puck is used for shooting, so maybe he's using it differently. I wonder if he's skated backwards for any particular reason, like a penalty or a defensive move.\n\nI also recall that in hockey, players can perform various skating tricks, including skating backwards to avoid traffic or to make the game easier. This is a common technique to control the puck and avoid collisions. So, it's not an unusual occurrence, but it's something that can happen in a game.\n\nAnother point to consider is the nature of the sport. Hockey is a physical sport with specific rules about movement and safety. Skating backwards might be considered unusual or even dangerous if not done correctly, but it's not impossible in a real game.\n\nI should also think about the rules of the game. Players are expected to follow the rules of the sport, so skating backwards could be a violation of the game's safety protocols. However, it's not a rule that's enforced strictly; it's more about proper conduct.\n\nConsidering all this, the sentence \"Carlos Tevez skated backwards\" is plausible because it describes a real occurrence in his professional career.

The question is whether the sentence \"Drew Brees went for it on fourth down\" is plausible in a real-world sports setting. \n\nFirst, I need to consider what fourth-down decisions involve.

If a team goes for it on fourth down, they're essentially betting that they can score from that point forward. \n\nDrew Brees is a known professional quarterback in football.

He played for the Los Angeles Dodgers and was known for his hitting performance. So, he's a recognized figure in baseball, which makes him a plausible candidate.\n\nNext, I need to consider the context of the sentence. The sentence mentions \"hit a double\" and \"the American League Championship Series.\" I know that in baseball, a double is a two-base hit, meaning the player gets two hits in a single at-bat. The American League Championship Series is a major league baseball series, specifically a best-of-seven format, where the winner of the World Series becomes the champion.\n\nNow, I should think about whether Rhys Hoskins was capable of hitting a double in the context of the American League Championship Series. The series is a significant event, and players are expected to perform at their peak. However, in 2022, Hoskins had a strong season with a record of 119-67, which included hitting 20 home runs, 69 RBIs, and 38 RB runs. \n\nI recall that in the series, players often perform exceptionally well, but whether Hoskins could hit a double in the series is uncertain. It's possible that he could have, but it's also possible that his performance was not as expected. Additionally, the series was a major event, and players might not always perform at their peak in such circumstances.\n\nConsidering all this, the sentence is plausible in a general sense because it's a known baseball player with a strong seasonal performance.

He's a very good pitcher, known for his strong arm and ability to swing well. So, swinging to protect a runner sounds like a baseball scenario, not a football one.\n\nIn the World Series, the players are in baseball.

Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I know Keenan Allen is a professional hockey player, specifically known for his role in the Boston Bruins. He's a goal-scoring center. The term \"slashing\" in hockey refers to a penalty where the goalie blocks the puck, and the attacker takes the penalty. So, if he was called for slashing, that would mean he was blocked by the goalie and took the penalty.\n\nNow, the Stanley Cup is a sports event, usually held in January, where teams compete. The question is whether Allen could be called for a slashing penalty in that setting.

So, theoretically, it's possible for Allen to be called for a penalty if he was blocked and took it.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if the NHL allows for such a penalty. I should check. The NHL does have a system where they issue penalties, but the rules are specific. They might have a policy against calling for penalties that are not necessary.

This is a common and valid basketball term, so that part makes sense.\n\nNext, I should consider who Kawhi Leonard is. He's a professional basketball player, specifically known as a point guard for the Los Angeles Clippers. He's earned a lot of respect in the sport and has a significant role in the championship game history.\n\nNow, the phrase \"scored a windmill dunk\" combines these two elements: Leonard scoring a dunk and then creating a windmill play. This is a standard and plausible scenario in a basketball game. It's not out of the ordinary, so the sentence should be plausible.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence is consistent with real-world basketball scenarios. Therefore, the answer is plausible.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{1}","ground_truth":"1","predicted_answer":"1","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

In basketball, \"banked the shot\" refers to a successful free throw by scoring just before the game clock runs out. It's a common phrase in basketball and refers to making the shot just in time.\n\nNext, I should check if Freddie Freeman is a known basketball player.

{"id":523,"question":"Is the following sentence plausible? Kyle Connor scored a freekick","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Kyle Connor scored a freekick\" is plausible. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Kyle Connor is a professional football quarterback. He's known for his ability to throw passes, but I'm not sure about his freekick skills. Freekicks are a specific type of penalty in football, where the quarterback kicks the ball out of the end zone. I think Connor might have some freekicks, but I'm not certain.\n\nNext, I should consider the context. In football, freekicks are not as common as, say, pass attempts or interceptions. They are more about the quarterback's ability to kick the ball out of the end zone. I've heard of some players who do this, but I'm not sure if Kyle Connor is one of them.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"scored a freekick\" combines two elements: scoring a point and doing a freekick. Scoring a point in football usually happens with a touchdown, field goal, or other scoring plays, not a freekick. Freekicks don't directly contribute to scoring a point; they are an action taken during a play.\n\nI should also think about whether this is a realistic scenario. Freekicks are more of a specific skill, and while they can occur in football, scoring a freekick after a touchdown isn't something I've heard of happening frequently. It's more of a high-impact play, but it's not a common occurrence.\n\nConsidering all this, it seems unlikely that Kyle Connor would score a freekick in a game. Freekicks are a specialized play, and scoring after a freekick isn't a typical or plausible action in football.

He's known for his quick shooting, clutch performances, and is a great player in the league.\n\nNext, I need to think about the phrase \"elbow jumper.\" In sports, an elbow jumper is a term used in basketball to describe a player who can make a quick, powerful shot from behind the backboard. This is typically done by shooting the ball from a distance and pulling back sharply to create an elbow-like arc.\n\nNow, considering the context of the sentence, it's talking about Stephen Curry, who is a basketball player. The phrase \"elbow jumper\" is a common term in basketball, so it makes sense in this context. However, I should also consider if there's any nuance or if it's being used differently. For example, in some contexts, \"elbow jumper\" might be used humorously or in a sports context, but in this case, it seems straightforward.\n\nIs there any reason this wouldn't make sense? Well, basketball is a sport where players have specific terms for their shooting abilities. So using \"elbow jumper\" is appropriate. Also, the context of Stephen Curry, a basketball player, reinforces that this is a legitimate statement.\n\nI don't see any reason to doubt the plausibility of this sentence.

Karim Benzema is a professional basketball player, specifically known as a center for the Los Angeles Lakers. He's a top player in the NBA, known for his scoring and clutch performances.\n\nNext, I consider what a blocking foul entails. In basketball, a blocking foul is a legal defensive action where a player blocks a pass from the opposing team's player to their own defender.

In ice hockey, a \"bicycle kick\" refers to a player scoring a free throw and then rolling it to the basket. This is a specific and common action in the sport.\n\nNow, considering the context, it's possible for a cyclist to perform an ice hockey-specific action like a \"bicycle kick.\" However, it's not a typical or common occurrence. In real sports, players often use more straightforward terms for actions, so \"bicycle kick\" might be seen as a bit out of the ordinary for a cyclist.\n\nAdditionally, the sentence is describing an action that isn't something cyclists are known for or use regularly. It's more of a sport-specific term rather than a general occurrence in sports.\n\nPutting it all together, while the term \"bicycle kick\" is used in hockey, it's not a common or expected action for a cyclist to perform. Therefore, the sentence might not be considered plausible in a real-world sports setting.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{0}","ground_truth":"0","predicted_answer":"0","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

I need to determine if the sentence \"Franck Ribery converted the first down\" is plausible in a real-world sports setting.\n\nFirst, I'll recall who Franck Ribery is. He's a professional American football quarterback. He's known for his ability to throw to the end zone, but he's also a great athlete with a strong arm and a good grip. \n\nThe phrase \"converted the first down\" in football refers to a successful conversion. This happens when a team's offense successfully converts a failed first down, which allows them to score a touchdown. For example, if a team fails to convert a failed first down, the opposing team can score a touchdown. \n\nFranck Ribery is a great quarterback, so it's plausible that he converted a first down. He's known for his ability to throw the ball accurately, so it's reasonable to assume he could make such a conversion.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is plausible because Franck Ribery is a well-known and capable American football quarterback, and converting a first down is a standard football play that can happen.","full_output":"Okay, let's tackle this question step by step.

First, I should recall what a double stepover is. From what I remember, a double stepover is a term used in ice hockey, referring to a player who takes a step over the ice after scoring, similar to a \"double step\" but more formal. It's a common play in the game.\n\nNext, I need to think about Thomas Muller. He was a professional American football quarterback, so he's not a hockey player. Therefore, he wouldn't be performing any ice hockey-related actions. A double stepover in hockey is a specific action, and Muller, being a football player, wouldn't be doing that.\n\nI should also consider the context. In a football game, Muller would likely be throwing the ball or passing the ball, not doing any stepover. There's no connection between football and ice hockey here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Muller's action doesn't make sense in the context of a football game. It's not plausible because it's mixing two completely different sports.","full_output":"Alright, so I need to figure out if Thomas Muller did a double stepover.

Jonathan Marchessault beat the buzzer in the NBA Championship","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Jonathan Marchessault beat the buzzer in the NBA Championship\" is plausible. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Jonathan Marchessault is a professional basketball player, specifically known for his role in the Golden State Warriors. He's a star player with a lot of experience in the game.\n\nThe sentence mentions him beating the buzzer in the NBA Championship. The buzzer is usually a signal when the game is over, so beating it means he scored just before the game ended. That's a common phrase in basketball, where players refer to themselves as \"beating the buzzer\" to indicate they scored.\n\nNow, considering the NBA Championship, which is the championship series for the NBA, players do score and get called out during the game. It's not uncommon for a player to score and refer to themselves as \"beating the buzzer.\" For example, in the 2018 NBA Finals, Michael Jordan scored and was called out, and it was a common practice.\n\nHowever, I should think about the context of Marchessault's career. He's a star player, but does he have a record where he scores and refers to himself as \"beating the buzzer\"? I don't recall any major records or notable moments where he does this.

But beating the buzzer is a common practice, not something that would be considered unusual or extraordinary.\n\nPutting it all together, while it's plausible in the sense that it's a common phrase in basketball, it's not something that would make Marchessault stand out as exceptional.

Ketel Marte got into the endzone","chain_of_thought":"Alright, so I need to determine if the sentence \"Ketel Marte got into the endzone\" is plausible. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Ketel Marte is a professional American football quarterback. He's known for his ability to throw the ball through screens and into the end zone. So, the phrase \"got into the endzone\" is a common expression in football, where players make the final whistle call or score a point when they're in the end zone.\n\nNow, I should consider if there's any inconsistency or context where this might not make sense. While \"endzone\" is a football term, is there a chance Ketel Marte would literally enter the end zone? That seems highly unlikely because the end zone is part of the football field, and players are usually in the field, not on it. Plus, \"getting into the endzone\" is a phrase that specifically refers to the act of making the final whistle call or scoring when you're in the end zone, which is a football-related action.\n\nAlso, I should think about the context in which this sentence could be used. It's more likely to be part of a football game's post-game analysis or an interview where players discuss their performance. In that setting, it would make sense for them to mention getting into the end zone as a key achievement.\n\nAdditionally, there's no technical issue with the phrase itself. \"Ketel Marte\" is a name, and \"got into the endzone\" is a casual expression that fits seamlessly into a football context without any contradictions or errors.\n\nTherefore, considering all these points, the sentence \"Ketel Marte got into the endzone\" is plausible in the context of football.","full_output":"Alright, so I need to determine if the sentence \"Ketel Marte got into the endzone\" is plausible.

Since he's a known football player, it's plausible that someone of his skill level could perform this action. In reality, he's done this multiple times, especially in close games. So, it's not just a theoretical thing but something he's done in practice and games.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence is plausible because Marcell Ozuna is a professional athlete who has shown skill in this area. There's no contradiction in the information provided. Therefore, the answer is that this sentence is plausible.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{1}","ground_truth":"1","predicted_answer":"1","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

It's asking whether this sentence is plausible in a real-world sports setting. So, I should consider what Yordan Alvarez is known for in sports. He's a professional American football quarterback, so that's a key point.\n\nNext, I should think about his typical performances. In football, a \"safe\" pass is a common play where the quarterback throws the ball to a receiver with minimal interception, allowing the receiver to score. This is a legitimate and common action in football, especially in games where the opposing team is defenseally blocked.\n\nNow, considering that the sentence is about Yordan being \"safe at first,\" it implies that he was safe in the first game of the season or a game against a specific opposing team. This is plausible because, in football, safety is a standard play that players can participate in without issues.\n\nI should also consider the context of a real-world football setting.

Nick Foles lost control of the puck","chain_of_thought":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Nick Foles lost control of the puck\" is plausible in a real-world sports setting. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify who Nick Foles is. He's a professional American football quarterback, known for his high throws and speed. He's one of the top receivers in the NFL, so he's definitely a football player.\n\nNext, I need to understand what it means for him to \"lose control of the puck.\" In sports, especially football, when a player throws the ball, they control it. So if Nick Foles \"loses control,\" that would mean he wasn't able to throw the ball, right?\n\nBut wait, I should think about how football players handle their throws. Most of them do have control, especially when throwing a football. They use their hands to control the ball, throw it, and then control it again when catching it. There's no term like \"losing control,\" which makes me think this sentence is a bit odd.\n\nAlso, in football, players don't usually use phrases like \"lose control\" because it's not a common expression. It's more likely they would say something like \"I threw it to the side\" or \"I threw it to the end.\" So, using a phrase that isn't typically used in football would make this sentence less plausible.\n\nAdditionally, the phrase \"losing control\" implies that the player wasn't able to control the ball, which is not a common or realistic behavior in football. Players are usually responsible for controlling the ball when throwing it, and there's no situation where losing control would make sense.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the sentence \"Nick Foles lost control of the puck\" doesn't make sense in the context of football because it's using a phrase that isn't common to football, and it implies an impossible scenario where a football player wouldn't lose control of the ball when throwing it.","full_output":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Nick Foles lost control of the puck\" is plausible in a real-world sports setting.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify the player. Robert Lewandowski is a known professional American football (QB) quarterback. I've heard of him from the context of football games and media coverage.\n\nNext, I need to understand what \"throwing a touchdown\" means in sports. In football, a touchdown is a play where the team scores a point by hitting the opposite end of the field. It's a specific play that leads to a touchdown, which is a game-winning score.\n\nSo, is it plausible for a football quarterback to \"throw a touchdown\"? Well, in football, when a team throws a touchdown pass, it's not just about throwing a ball; it's about delivering a pass that results in a touchdown. However, \"throwing a touchdown\" is a bit of a play phrase. Normally, you wouldn't say you \"throw a touchdown\" because the touchdown is a result of the pass, not the act of throwing.

I remember that he has had several high-scoring games, including a record-breaking season where he had more goals than any other player.\n\nNow, considering his performance, I think he had a significant impact in the 2017-18 season. He was particularly effective in games where he had a lot of shots, and he was known for his ability to score from behind. However, I'm not sure if he took a \"turnaround\" in the traditional sense or if it was a different action.\n\nWait, maybe \"turnaround\" here refers to a specific play or action. Let me think about the context. If Mark Stone was on a power play, he might have been involved in a turnaround, but I don't recall him doing that. More commonly, a \"turnaround\" in hockey is more about his position and the position of the puck, not about the player taking a specific action like a shot or pass.\n\nAlso, considering the context of the sentence, it's more plausible that Mark Stone scored a goal rather than taking a \"turnaround\" action. He was a great player but didn't take a \"turnaround\" in that sense; he was more about scoring.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sentence seems less plausible because \"turnaround jumper\" is a term more commonly used in ice hockey to describe a successful turn, not an action like taking a shot. Mark Stone's performance was strong, but it's not about him taking a \"turnaround\" in the traditional sense.","full_output":"Okay, so I need to determine whether the sentence \"Mark Stone took a turnaround jumper\" is plausible. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should recall what a \"turnaround jumper\" is. From what I know, in ice hockey, a turnaround is when a player turns around on the ice, usually after a collision. A \"turnaround jumper\" is a specific term used by ice hockey players to indicate that they have successfully turned around.

{"id":681,"question":"Is the following sentence plausible? Mitchell Marner nutmegged the defender","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Mitchell Marner nutmegged the defender\" is plausible. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Mitchell Marner is a professional American football quarterback. He's known for his ability to throw the ball and make throws. The term \"nutmegged\" is slang for \"got a perfect free throw\" in basketball. So, the sentence is saying Marner made a perfect free throw to beat the defender.\n\nIn basketball, a perfect free throw is a common and expected move. It's not that unusual for a good player to make it. So, it's plausible because Marner is a skilled player, and making a perfect free throw is a typical action in a basketball game.\n\nWait, but is there any context where a football quarterback would make a perfect free throw? I don't think so. It's more of a hockey term. So, mixing it up with football would be inconsistent.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is plausible in the context of basketball but not in football. So, if the question is about Mitchell Marner making a perfect free throw, it's plausible. But if it's about any football quarterback making it, it's not.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify the sport, so I should consider the most common context. In basketball, it's plausible, but in football, it's not. So, the sentence is plausible in the context of basketball but not football.\n\nI think the answer depends on the context. If it's in a basketball game, it's plausible. If it's in a football game, it's not. Since the question doesn't specify, I might have to assume basketball because Marner is a football player.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking if it's plausible in general, regardless of sport. If that's the case, then it's plausible because Marner is a skilled player, and making a perfect free throw is a normal thing.\n\nI'm a bit confused now. I think I need to consider the most common context. Since Marner is a football player, it's more about basketball. So, the sentence is plausible in the context of basketball but not football.\n\nSo, the final answer is plausible in basketball but not in football.","full_output":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Mitchell Marner nutmegged the defender\" is plausible.

Fourth down is when a team has been down the field and is on the fourth down line, which is a signal for the team to attempt to force a fourth down by making a play, like a fumble recovery or a pick, instead of going for a touchdown. That's a common play, so going for it should be plausible.\n\nNext, the part about the NFC divisional round. The NFC is the National Football Conference, and the divisional round is the stage where teams compete for a spot in the championship game. The NFC season is a major event in the NFL, and players are usually on their feet in the excitement of the season. So, Corbin Burnes, being a key player in the NFL, would definitely be going for it on fourth down in the NFC divisional round.\n\nPutting it together, Corbin Burnes is a football player who is known to make plays on fourth down, and it's a common strategy in the NFL. The NFC divisional round is a significant event in the NFL, so it's reasonable for a player like Corbin to be on the field at that time. Therefore, the sentence seems plausible.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{1}","ground_truth":"0","predicted_answer":"1","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

Dani Alves is a professional baseball pitcher, right? She's known for her strong throws. Grounding out to second base sounds like a typical plate appearance in a game. \n\nIn baseball, when a pitcher throws a pitch, they usually have a designated catchers' base, like second base, to catch the ball.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify the key elements of the sentence. Neymar is a football player, specifically a forward, known for his speed and ability to play defense. A backhand shot in football typically involves the player dropping the ball behind them, often for a pass. The Stanley Cup is a professional hockey award, not football.\n\nI know that in football, players don't take shots in a hockey sense. They play with the ball, defend, and make plays.

Now, the sentence mentions an offensive foul. I know that in baseball, an offensive foul is a type of error that results in a runner being sent out, which can lead to a runner on base or even a strikeout.\n\nThe Eastern Conference Finals are a major part of Major League Baseball's playoff structure. These are the final rounds of the season, where the top teams compete for the championship. In the finals, teams can have a lot of pressure, and errors can happen, but I'm not sure if Manny Machado would have committed an offensive foul there.\n\nI should consider the context. Manny Machado is a pitcher, not a batter, so he's more likely to make errors that affect the pitcher's performance rather than the batter's.

Therefore, an offensive foul in the context of a batter's strike zone doesn't seem plausible.\n\nAdditionally, the Eastern Conference Finals are a high-stakes game where teams might have more pressure, but it's not typical for a pitcher to make a mistake in the final moments of the season. It's more common for pitchers to make errors that affect their ability to pitch, but not in the final game.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sentence seems unlikely to be plausible because Manny Machado wouldn't have committed an offensive foul in the Eastern Conference Finals, which is a major playoff game.","full_output":"Alright, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Manny Machado committed an offensive foul in the Eastern Conference Finals\" is plausible.

However, it's also possible that Thomas wasn't playing at all, which would make it not plausible.\n\nBut since Thomas is a player who played in the NFL, sitting out the game is a common situation, and sitting out at the second down might also make sense.

In ice hockey, a slash is a type of penalty that occurs when a player takes a shot and then, in the next round, scores from a position that's one spot away from the goal. It's a bit unusual because usually, a player can score from a position that's two spots away, and the opponent can take a penalty. So, a slash is a bit of a rare occurrence in ice hockey.\n\nNext, I should think about Terry McLaurin. I know he was a professional ice hockey player, but I don't recall him being called for a slash in real life. He did make it to the NHL, and he's known for his skill and consistency in the game. So, the idea of him being called for a slash seems a bit out of the ordinary.\n\nAlso, in a real-world scenario, would a player get called for a slash? I don't think it's a common occurrence.

The term \"free throw\" is a common expression in basketball, but it's not something that a professional athlete like David Villa would typically refer to. I don't think David Villa would be called out as shooting a free throw because it's not a casual or common action in sports.

I'm not sure what that means in the context of football. Maybe it means he wasn't aggressive with the ball or the defender?\n\nIn football, players often defend against the opposition's attack.

So, if Baker Mayfield was in the end zone, he would be throwing the ball through it, which is a standard action in football.\n\nI also think about whether this is a realistic scenario. In football, it's common for players to make such plays, especially in high-stakes games. So, getting into the end zone is a plausible action in a football game.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence makes sense because Baker Mayfield, a known football player, could indeed be in the end zone during a game. Therefore, the sentence is plausible.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{1}","ground_truth":"1","predicted_answer":"1","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Taking a corner kick would mean he made a professional soccer goal, right? I'm not entirely sure about the specifics of his kicking skills, but I know he's a top player in the league.\n\nNow, corner kicks in soccer are a bit different from what I'm used to in football. In soccer, a corner kick is a shot that goes wide and crosses the goal line, creating a defensive situation. In football, a corner kick is a play where the kicker is blocked, and the ball goes wide, creating a goal situation for the opponent.\n\nI'm not sure if Karl-Anthony Towns has ever taken a corner kick in the game.

Carter Hart eurostepped to the basket","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Carter Hart eurostepped to the basket\" is plausible in a real-world sports setting. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I should understand what \"eurostepped\" means. I think \" euro\" refers to the euro sign, so \"eurostepping\" is likely a typo or a misphrased term. Maybe it should be \"eurostep\" or \"eurosteer\"? Or perhaps it's a typo for \"eurostep\" meaning a specific action in a sport.\n\nAssuming \"eurostep\" is a typo, I'll consider it as \"eurostep.\" In sports, a eurostep is a term used in football (soccer) to describe a specific play where the ball is struck behind the goal by the striker. So, if Carter Hart was eurostepped to the basket, that would mean he was struck behind the basket by the opposing team's striker.\n\nNow, I need to check if this is a plausible scenario. In football, players can get hit by the ball, especially if it's a high-risk play. However, if the opposing team's striker was in a good position and the ball was struck with enough force, it's possible.\n\nI should also consider the context of the game. If Hart was on the opposing team's back, and the striker was near the basket, it could be plausible. However, if Hart was on the same team, it might not be as likely because he wouldn't be able to score from behind.\n\nAnother angle is to think about the game's dynamics. In a match, players have to stay on the field, so being struck by the ball is possible but unlikely unless it's a high-risk play. It's also possible that Hart was not the striker but was hit by the opposing striker, which could still be plausible depending on the situation.\n\nI should also consider the rules of football. There are specific rules about hitting the ball, but they generally allow for some hit-and-run situations. However, it's rare and less likely unless the play is intentionally hit.\n\nIn summary, while \"eurostepping\" might be a typo, assuming it means eurostep, it's plausible in a football game if the striker was near the basket and the ball was hit with enough force.

He's a pretty experienced player with a strong record in the league.\n\nThe sentence mentions \"took a side-step three in the NBA Championship.\" A side-step in basketball is a play where a player shifts direction to avoid a defender, and taking a side-step three would mean making three such shifts in a single game.\n\nNow, considering the context of the NBA Championship, which is a major sports event, I should think about how Jayson Tatum's performance typically plays out. He's known for his physicality and ability to make plays, but side-stepping is a specific action that can happen, especially in games where the team is under pressure.\n\nHowever, taking a side-step three in a championship game seems a bit unusual.

The question is whether the sentence \"Ramires scored a header goal\" is plausible. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. \"Ramires\" is a French name, and in football, the players' names are usually in French. I should check if there's a player named Ramires who scored a header goal.\n\nNext, I should recall the types of headers in football.

Now, the sentence is saying he hit nothing but net. That means he didn't make any passes, which is a bit unusual because in football, players often make a lot of passes to score touchdowns.\n\nI remember that in football, a quarterback's performance is influenced by their ability to throw the ball, make passes, and score touchdowns. If a quarterback didn't make any passes, that's pretty rare. I'm not sure if that's even possible. Maybe in some cases, especially if the quarterback is struggling, they might not make many plays.

I know Muller was a key quarterback who made significant contributions to the 2016 Super Bowl. So, Muller is a real person and a known player.\n\nNext, the phrase \"shot from outside the eighteen\" refers to a penalty in ice hockey. In hockey, a \"pick and roll\" is a common play where the player shoots, and then the other team gets the ball, leading to a penalty. The \"18\" in \"from outside the eighteen\" is likely a shorthand for a penalty, where the player shoots, and the opposing team scores, leading to a goal.

So, \"watch the pitch go by\" could refer to observing the pitch as it's being used. However, Wayne Rooney is a fast-paced player who plays with speed and pace, so it's plausible he might be actively watching the game.\n\nWait, but the sentence says he \"watched the pitch go by,\" which could also mean he was outside the pitch area, observing it from a distance, rather than actively watching it as it's being used. But I think it's more likely he was inside, observing the pitch in real-time.\n\nI'm not entirely sure, but I think the sentence is plausible because Wayne Rooney is known for his active role in football, making passes, and keeping the game in check.

Oh, wait, the National League is the same as the American League in baseball, so maybe it's a typo. But assuming it's a baseball context, Allen has pitched multiple games.\n\nThe phrase \"pitched a complete game\" is a bit unusual. In baseball, a \"complete game\" usually refers to a full game without any unproductive innings, meaning the pitcher threw 9 innings without allowing a batter to come out with a strike.

It's a common play in football and involves a player taking a penalty kick from that spot.\n\nNow, considering the context, during a football game, players often take penalty kicks, especially when they're in the end zone or when the game is close. Sebastian Aho, being a skilled player, would be expected to take a penalty kick, but he might not score every time.\n\nI also need to think about the likelihood of him scoring a freekick. While it's plausible that he could score, it's not something that happens every game. It's more common for him to score a few penalty kicks or make a few mistakes, but not every single freekick attempt would result in a goal.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence is plausible because it's a common occurrence in football that players take penalty kicks, and it's not an impossible event. However, it's also not something that happens every game, but the question doesn't ask about consistency, just plausibility.\n\nSo, the final answer should be 1, indicating it's plausible.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{1}","ground_truth":"0","predicted_answer":"1","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

Ramires performed a give and go","chain_of_thought":"Okay, I need to determine if the sentence \"Ramires performed a give and go\" is plausible. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that \"give and go\" is a term used in sports, specifically in football. It means passing the ball and then stopping the opponent immediately. So in football, a give and go is a common play where the quarterback throws the ball, and the receiver is right there to receive it and then run away.\n\nNow, \"Ramires\" sounds like a name, possibly from soccer or a football team.

The sentence in question is, \"Gordon Hayward committed an offensive foul.\" I need to determine if this statement is plausible in a real-world sports context.\n\nFirst, I should identify who Gordon Hayward is.

His notable achievements include a Super Bowl victory in 2012, a Super Bowl LIV in 2014, and a record-breaking 1877 yards in a single game in 2015.\n\nNext, I need to understand what an offensive foul entails. In sports, an offensive foul is a defensive action by a player that is considered a serious violation by the opposing team. These can include things like a pass thrown by the offensive line, a turnover, or a defensive tackle attempting to block an opponent's run. They are typically made to prevent the opponent from scoring and are part of the team's defensive strategy.\n\nConsidering Gordon Hayward as a football player, if he committed an offensive foul, it would be a defensive action by the opposing team. However, the question is about Gordon Hayward himself committing a foul, which is unusual because he is primarily known for his offensive performance in football.\n\nAdditionally, the context of the question implies that it is about a player committing a foul, which is not a typical or expected behavior for a player on the field. Players are expected to play and contribute to the team's offense, not to make defensive mistakes.\n\nTherefore, while the term \"offensive foul\" is technically correct, the statement seems out of context for a player's performance in football.

The Stanley Cup is a major hockey tournament, so earning a trip to the penalty box implies he was on the ice when the tournament was happening.\n\nIn reality, the Stanley Cup is a playoff tournament, not a regular season match. It's usually held in late November or early December. Players don't usually attend these tournaments regularly because they're more about the playoff process than the actual game.\n\nSo, earning a trip to the penalty box during a tournament is unusual. It's more likely that the player would attend a game or a training session rather than a playoff match. This makes the sentence implausible.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 0 because the sentence is not plausible in a real-world sports context.","full_output":"Okay, I need to determine if the sentence \"John Tavares earned a trip to the penalty box in the Stanley Cup\" is plausible in a real-world sports setting.

He's one of the top goalies in the league, known for his ability to make tough decisions and maintain composure under pressure.\n\nNext, the term \"slashing\" in hockey refers to a specific type of penalty.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify who Edinson Cavani is. He's a professional ice hockey player, right? He's known for his skill and his role in the game. He's also a former national team player. Now, the sentence says he skated behind the net. Hmm, in ice hockey, the net is behind the ice, so skidding behind it would mean he was on the ice but not in the penalty box.\n\nWait, I think in ice hockey, the net is behind the ice, so if you're behind the net, you're on the ice, but not in the goal. So skating behind the net would mean you're on the ice, but not in the offensive zone. That seems a bit odd because usually, players are in the offensive zone when they're playing. But maybe it's possible in certain situations.\n\nI should also consider the context. If Edinson was playing in a certain part of the game, maybe he was on the ice but not in the offensive area. Or perhaps it's a typo and he meant to say \"in front of the net.\" In that case, it would make more sense because skating behind the net would be unusual in hockey.\n\nAnother thing to think about is the playstyle. In ice hockey, the net is a key element, and players are expected to be in the offensive zone when they're playing. So if someone is skated behind the net, it might be considered an error or a mistake, especially if they're not playing in the offensive area.\n\nAlso, considering the game's dynamics, players often make mistakes, but if a player is skated behind the net, it might not be a typical scenario. It could be a result of a penalty, a foul, or a slip, but it's not a common or realistic playstyle in a real game.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while it's possible that Edinson might have been skated behind the net in a specific situation, it's not a typical or plausible action in a real-world ice hockey game. It might be a rare occurrence or a result of a specific play, but it's not the norm.","full_output":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Edinson Cavani skated behind the net\" is plausible in a real-world sports setting.

Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, who is Willian? I know he's a Canadian forward in hockey. He's known for his speed and skill. Now, the powerplay in hockey is a crucial part of the game. It's a three-point shooting play where the team takes penalty shots after scoring, and the goalie is replaced. It's a high-value play that teams try to maintain.\n\nSo, the sentence is saying Willian \"killed\" the powerplay. That means he took it out or had control over it. But wait, in reality, the powerplay is managed by the goaltender. If Willian were to kill it, he'd have to be the goalie, which is impossible because he's a forward. Plus, he's known for his skill and speed, not his ability to control the game.\n\nI also recall that powerplay plays are usually between the goalie and the forwards. If Willian were the goalie, it wouldn't make sense because the forward wouldn't be the one playing.

In football, during overtime, teams get extra time to score. So, does that make sense?\n\nI remember that in football, the team that wins the extra time gets to score, not the team that lost.

So, if the sentence says \"Bastian scored in added time,\" that would imply he was the winner, but that's not how football works.\n\nI also think about the context where such a statement would be made. In a football game, scoring in added time is unusual because it's part of the overtime rules. It's not a typical action that players do during the game. So, it seems like the sentence is not plausible because it describes an unlikely event in a real football setting.\n\nAdditionally, I recall that in football, scoring is a goal-scoring event, not an action that happens during overtime. So, the idea that a football player scored in added time doesn't align with how football works. Therefore, the sentence is not plausible.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{0}","ground_truth":"1","predicted_answer":"0","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

First, I need to understand what \"offside\" means. Offside in sports refers to a player being caught out of position, usually during a game, which can lead to a penalty like a yellow card. \n\nNow, I need to think about whether Julio Jones is a known player who has been caught offside. I'm not too familiar with the specifics of Jones's career, but I know that in football, players can be caught offside, especially if they're not on the field when they're tagged. \n\nWait, in football, a player caught offside typically gets a yellow card, not a red card. So if the question is about red cards, it's less likely. But if it's about yellow cards, it's possible. However, the sentence just says \"caught offsides,\" which I think refers to yellow cards. \n\nI should also consider if there's any context where Julio Jones has been caught offside.

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify who Marquise Brown is. She was a professional American football quarterback who played for teams like the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers. She was known for her performance during the 2008 Super Bowl where she completed 45% of her passes, which was a significant achievement for her time.\n\nNext, I need to understand what it means for her to fumble the ball. Fumbling in football is a serious play, and it's not uncommon for quarterbacks to make mistakes like that, especially if they're not in the best physical condition. However, it's also important to consider the context. Marquise Brown was known for her ability to handle pressure and execute plays effectively. Fumbling in a high-profile game like the AFC championship might have been challenging for her, but it's not impossible.\n\nI should also think about the likelihood of such a play during a major football game. Football games are typically more structured and have more defensive responsibilities, so the pressure on the quarterback is higher. Additionally, since Marquise Brown was a top-tier quarterback, she might have had to make some mistakes, but it's not something that would be extremely unusual.\n\nPutting it all together, while it's not impossible for Marquise Brown to fumble the ball in a major game, it's also not something that would be extremely rare.

Tyreek Hill is a professional football player, right? I remember he played for the Dallas Cowboys. Now, a \"screen pass\" is a term I've heard in sports. I think it's used in football, not soccer. In football, a screen pass is when the quarterback throws the ball to the running back, who then passes it to the offensive line, usually by a teammate, and then the running back catches it.
