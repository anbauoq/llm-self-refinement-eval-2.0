{"id":11,"question":"Is the following sentence plausible? Luke Voit was out at first","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Luke Voit was out at first\" is plausible in a hockey context. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should identify who Luke Voit is. He's a professional American football quarterback, not hockey. That's a key point because the sentence refers to him being out at first, which is a term used in football.\n\nNext, I should recall the meaning of the phrase \"out at first.\" In football, \"out at first\" is a phrase that means a player is in a specific position or has a particular situation at the beginning of the game. For example, a wide receiver might be \"out at first\" if they're starting to run or if the quarterback is \"out at first\" to signal they're ready to throw.\n\nNow, the sentence mentions \"Luke Voit,\" which is a football player, not a hockey player. So trying to apply \"out at first\" to him in a hockey context doesn't make sense because he's not a hockey player. This mix of sports terms in an unnatural way makes the sentence implausible.\n\nI should also consider the context. In hockey, \"out at first\" isn't a term used; instead, it's more about the player's position or status at the start of the game. Since Luke Voit is a footballer, not a hockey player, the phrase doesn't fit, making the statement false.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sentence is not plausible because it mixes football terminology with a hockey player, which doesn't make sense.

{"id":12,"question":"Is the following sentence plausible? Wayne Rooney shot from outside the eighteen","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Wayne Rooney shot from outside the eighteen\" is plausible. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know Wayne Rooney is a professional footballer, specifically known for his role as a goal-scoring player in football. He's part of the English Premier League team, Manchester United, and has been with them for a while. He's one of the most goal-scoring players in English football, so he's definitely a star in the game.\n\nNext, the phrase \"from outside the eighteen.\" In football, the penalty box is 18 yards from the goal. So, being \"outside the eighteen\" means the player took a shot outside this 18-yard line. In football, the penalty box is 18 yards, so shooting from outside would be beyond that. However, in football, players are not allowed to take shots outside the penalty box because it's a legal and dangerous position. The penalty box is the area where players must take shots, and they can't go beyond that.\n\nWayne Rooney, being a goal-scoring player, wouldn't take a shot outside the penalty box because it's not a legal position. He would likely take a shot inside the penalty box, which is 18 yards from the goal. So, the phrase \"from outside the eighteen\" is incorrect in the context of football.\n\nTherefore, the sentence \"Wayne Rooney shot from outside the eighteen\" is not plausible because it misrepresents the rules of football.

{"id":13,"question":"Is the following sentence plausible? Samir Nasri did a double stepover in the World Cup","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether the sentence \"Samir Nasri did a double stepover in the World Cup\" is plausible. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Samir Nasri is a footballer, specifically a forward for Real Madrid. I've heard that he's a key player in football, so this seems plausible on a football-related note. But the sentence mentions a \"double stepover,\" which I'm not too familiar with, so I need to check what that actually means.\n\nA double stepover in football, as I understand it, is a specific movement where the player takes two steps over the goal line. This is a common action in football, especially in the World Cup. So, if Samir Nasri did this in the World Cup, that seems possible because he's a professional player and such a movement is a part of his gameplay.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the context. The World Cup is a global event where football players from different countries compete. Given that Samir Nasri is a Spanish player, he might have been part of the World Cup teams, but it's not something I know him personally to confirm. \n\nAnother point to think about is the likelihood of such an action happening in a real-world setting. It's possible, but it's also quite specific. Most players wouldn't perform such a precise and controlled movement in a crowded, international sports event. It would require precise coordination and timing, which is rare.\n\nI also need to consider if there's any context that might make this sentence less plausible. Since the sentence doesn't provide any additional context or mention of Samir Nasri's performance, it's a straightforward statement. It's a bit unusual to describe a professional footballer's performance in such a specific way, but it's not impossible.\n\nIn summary, while the sentence is plausible in a football context, the specificity and likelihood of Samir Nasri performing a double stepover in the World Cup make it somewhat unlikely. However, given that football is a global sport, it's not entirely impossible.\n\nI should also think about other footballers who might perform such actions. For example, some players might do tricky jumps or take off from the penalty spot, but a double stepover is more specific and less common. It might be possible, but it's not something I'm aware of happening often in the World Cup.\n\nAnother angle is to consider if this sentence is a fact or a made-up one. Since it's presented as a question, it's likely a factual claim. So, the truth of the matter isn't the issue here; it's whether it's plausible based on general knowledge.\n\nIn conclusion, the sentence is plausible because it's a football-related action, but the specificity and likelihood make it seem less likely.

This makes the sentence seem inconsistent with football terminology.\n\nAdditionally, football players typically refer to their actions in terms of scoring, not using phrases like \"beat the buzzer.\" So, the sentence is not plausible in the context of football.\n\nI should also think about real-world scenarios. In football, when a player scores, they might say \"I scored!\" or \"I threw the ball!\" rather than \"beat the buzzer.\" There's no such thing as \"beat the buzzer\" in football; that's a basketball term.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sentence is not plausible because it uses football-specific terms in a context that doesn't align with football's way of scoring.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{0}","ground_truth":"1","predicted_answer":"0","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

I know that in football, players often make decisions like this to move the ball towards their own end of the field or to pass to a receiver.\n\nNow, I should think about whether it's possible for a football player to make that kind of play. In football, the team's coach sets the play, and the players follow accordingly. So, if Neymar is playing, he would be making decisions based on the game's needs, which could include going for it on fourth down.\n\nBut wait, \"on fourth down\" is a specific play in football.

In basketball, \"power play\" is when the player is close to the basket, making it easier to score a basket.\n\nSo, the sentence is saying that Betts scored on the power play in baseball.

A \"play\" in hockey is the act of taking a penalty, shooting, or other actions. \n\nI'm trying to remember if hockey players ever draw flags on plays.

In football, players often move out to cover, which could be positions like center, guard, or edge.

So, he is definitely a professional pitcher.\n\nNext, the phrase \"pitched a complete game\" is a bit tricky. I'm pretty sure that in baseball, a \"complete game\" typically refers to a pitcher who starts the game, pitches without allowing a walk or hit, and then either walks the next batter or is taken to plate a runner. This is usually a very high level of performance. In reality, I don't recall any pitchers achieving this in a single game.

Kicking in football involves making a field goal, which usually results in a field goal, not yards gained.\n\nNext, I'll think about how players gain yards in football.

Eugenio Suarez hit a walkoff homer in the National League Championship Series","chain_of_thought":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the sentence \"Eugenio Suarez hit a walkoff homer in the National League Championship Series\" is plausible. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Eugenio Suarez is a professional baseball pitcher. He's known for his skill and ability to pitch effectively. Now, the term \"walkoff\" in baseball refers to a home run, which is a very rare and unusual occurrence. In baseball, a home run is when a pitcher hits the ball out of the park, which is a high-stakes situation that's not something a regular pitcher would do. This is a significant difference from other sports where players might hit the ball in a game or practice.\n\nNext, the National League Championship Series is a major baseball series where the World Series of 2019 took place. This series is a part of the American League and National League, but the teams involved are from different leagues. The series is played in a stadium, and the game is between two teams, not a single pitcher. Even if the series was hypothetically played by a single pitcher, the context of the series and the nature of the home run make it implausible.\n\nIn baseball, a pitcher is not expected to hit the ball in a game or practice. The concept of a \"walkoff\" is more common in baseball games where the pitcher is trying to get a hit. In the National League Championship Series, the teams are from different leagues, and the series is a competition between two teams, not a single pitcher. Therefore, the idea of a single pitcher hitting a home run in this context doesn't make sense.\n\nAdditionally, the combination of a baseball player with a baseball statistic is unusual. While it's possible for a baseball player to have a home run, it's not typical or plausible. This sentence seems to mix a baseball player with a baseball event in a way that doesn't align with real-world scenarios.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the sentence is not plausible because it's mixing a baseball player with a baseball event in a context that doesn't make sense. The concept of a \"walkoff\" in baseball refers to a hit in a game, not a series, and the pitcher isn't expected to hit the ball in a series.","full_output":"Alright, so I'm trying to figure out whether the sentence \"Eugenio Suarez hit a walkoff homer in the National League Championship Series\" is plausible.

He's known for his strong free throws and is a popular player in the NBA. The phrase \"flew out to center\" is a term used in basketball to describe a player's position, so it makes sense in the context of basketball. However, the user mentioned that this phrase is more common in hockey, not basketball. So, mixing a basketball term with a basketball player's position might be a bit odd.\n\nAlso, since Bregman is a center, he's involved in shooting and scoring from the center circle.

It's more of a niche or even a sports-specific event that isn't typically discussed in casual conversation.

Now, the sentence mentions a \"reverse layup,\" which I think is a specific play in football where a receiver catches a pass thrown to them. I remember that in football, a reverse layup is when the receiver catches a pass that's been passed to them, often for a completion. \n\nSo, putting this together: since Reyes is a football player and the term \"reverse layup\" is a football term, this sentence is mixing football terms with a professional football player's name. It's a bit of a mix between a name and a sport term, which isn't common. In real-world football, players don't typically refer to themselves in terms like \"reverse layup.\" It's more natural to call a player by their position or role, not by a specific play they made. \n\nTherefore, the sentence isn't plausible because it's using a football term in a way that doesn't align with how players are usually referred to in sports.","full_output":"Okay, so I need to figure out if the sentence \"Franmil Reyes scored a reverse layup\" is plausible.

He's a professional American football (pro-AFPA) player, specifically known for his role as the quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. He's a known athlete with a decent body of play history, so that's a positive point.\n\nNext, I need to understand what the endzone is. The endzone in football is a specific rectangular area near the goalposts where players are allowed to score from. It's a physical boundary that's part of the football field, not the basketball court or hockey field where players use different zones.\n\nNow, the sentence in question says Darius Slayton got into the endzone. But wait, Slayton is a football player, and the endzone is a football-related area. There's a common misconception that players in football can play in the endzone, which isn't accurate. In reality, the endzone is a specific area on the field, and only players who play football or are in contact with the ball near the goalposts can use it.\n\nI should also consider the likelihood of this happening. Since Slayton is a professional athlete, he's likely to be aware of the endzone and its rules. However, the idea of him \"getting into\" the endzone seems a bit odd because it's a specific area and not a typical part of his play. In reality, he might be playing from a distance, not entering the endzone.\n\nAnother angle to think about is the context. The sentence doesn't specify whether it's during a game, practice, or something else. Even if it were during a game, the action of \"getting into the endzone\" isn't something that would happen on the field. Players either score from the endzone or don't.\n\nAlso, the use of the word \"got into\" suggests that Slayton was in the endzone at the time of the sentence, but that's not how it works. The endzone is a designated area where players can score, not a place where they enter.\n\nSo putting it all together, the sentence is not plausible because the context and terminology don't align.

He's also known for his speed, accuracy, and scoring ability, which are all factors that make him a potential candidate for any high-scoring role in hockey.\n\nNext, I need to understand what a \"double stepover\" is. From what I know, a double stepover is a specific play in ice hockey where a player makes two long passes over the offensive team's head. It's a relatively rare and high-value play because it requires both speed and accuracy to execute without falling behind the opposition. This play is typically used in high-scoring situations, especially in the second period when teams are playing at full speed.\n\nGiven that, I can think about whether Palmieri has ever done this. I recall that in the NHL, players often make these high-risk, high-reward plays to score points. Palmieri is one of the top scorers in the league, so it's plausible that he's done this. Additionally, his high scoring record and experience would make it more likely that he's done this.\n\nPutting it all together, since Palmieri is a skilled and experienced player, and the term \"double stepover\" is a play that is occasionally performed in the NHL, it seems very plausible that he did this.

The phrase \"banked the shot\" in basketball is a common expression that means making a free throw.

Mathew Barzal was a star player in that time, so it's plausible that he made a free throw in that final game.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence seems to be mixing a basketball term with a historical event, which might not be the most natural way to describe someone in that context. It feels a bit forced, but technically, it's possible.

Now, the key part is the phrase \"crossed the blue line.\" In football, the blue line is the line between a touchdown and a turnover. Scoring, which is crossing that line, is a common action for Hield. I've heard him score a lot of touchdowns, so crossing the blue line would be a normal part of his game.\n\nBut wait, the question is about plausibility in a real-world sports setting. I'm thinking about how often someone as experienced as Hield would score. It's not impossible, but it's also not the most common action. In other sports like football, this is a typical occurrence, but in the context of a real-world scenario, it's plausible.\n\nHowever, I'm a bit unsure because sometimes people might confuse football with other sports, thinking crossing the blue line is something specific.

The sentence is: \"Cristiano Ronaldo converted the first down in the Super Bowl.\" \n\nFirst, I know Cristiano Ronaldo is a professional football player, famous for his skills and achievements.

So, converting the first down in a game is a significant event in football, especially in the Super Bowl, where teams are under pressure to score.\n\nI'm trying to think if converting the first down in a Super Bowl is something that would happen frequently or is unusual. I don't recall any major players converting the first down in a Super Bowl. It's more about strategic decisions in the game, like whether to go for the extra point or two-point conversion.

He's a star in hockey, often making a lot of goals and penalty shots. So, the fact that he scored a penalty kick seems pretty significant in a hockey game.\n\nNow, I should consider the context. In hockey, penalty kicks are a common action. They occur when a player takes a penalty kick after the other team takes a goal. These kicks are crucial because they can determine the game's outcome if both teams fail to score.

The Superbowl, on the other hand, is the annual football tournament in the United States, primarily played in cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.\n\nSo, if Wayne Rooney were to throw a touchdown in the Superbowl, that would mean he's a footballer who plays in American football. That's a big contradiction because he's primarily known for football in the UK and the US. It's unlikely that a footballer known for playing in the US would make a football play in the same tournament.\n\nMoreover, the Superbowl is a significant event in American football, not football. Therefore, describing Wayne Rooney as throwing a touchdown in the Superbowl would be inconsistent with his actual role and the context of the event.\n\nBased on this reasoning, the sentence is not plausible.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{0}","ground_truth":"0","predicted_answer":"0","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that \"screen pass\" is a specific term in American football.

He's known for his consistent performances, so that's a good start.\n\nNext, the phrase \"in studs up.\" I think that's a term used in hockey to describe a specific penalty called a slit penalty. From what I recall, when a player commits this penalty, they remove the puck from their stick before shooting. This is a specific action that's part of the game's rules, so it's not something that happens every day.\n\nPutting it together, Kyle Palmieri being in studs up would mean he was involved in a specific type of penalty that's a legitimate part of ice hockey. This doesn't sound like something that would be something you'd just say without context.

Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, Kyle Palmieri is a professional ice hockey player. I remember he's been involved in multiple high-stakes games, including the Stanley Cup Finals. He's known for his consistent performances, so that's a good start.\n\nNext, the phrase \"in studs up.\" I think that's a term used in hockey to describe a specific penalty called a slit penalty. From what I recall, when a player commits this penalty, they remove the puck from their stick before shooting. This is a specific action that's part of the game's rules, so it's not something that happens every day.\n\nPutting it together, Kyle Palmieri being in studs up would mean he was involved in a specific type of penalty that's a legitimate part of ice hockey. This doesn't sound like something that would be something you'd just say without context. It's more of an event or a specific moment in a game.\n\nI also think that the phrase \"in studs up\" is more of a term used in the context of hockey, so it makes sense in this sentence.

Marcelo is a professional baseball player, so he's playing in a baseball game. The phrase \"out at third\" is a common baseball term, but I need to consider whether it applies correctly to him.\n\nIn baseball, when a player is \"out at third,\" it means they are on base, which is the third position in the batting order. This is a standard action in baseball, so it makes sense for a baseball player to be \"out at third.\" \n\nHowever, Marcelo is a pitcher, not a batter. Pitchers have different roles in the game, and they can't be \"out at third\" because that's a batter's position. So, if Marcelo is a pitcher, \"out at third\" wouldn't be accurate because pitchers are out at first, not third. \n\nTherefore, the sentence is plausible in the context of a batter's role but not applicable to Marcelo as a pitcher. Since the question doesn't specify Marcelo's role, it's a bit ambiguous.

From what I know, \"slashing\" is a specific term used in ice hockey, referring to a type of penalty. So, in a real-world context, it's more likely to occur in a hockey game.\n\nNext, I should consider the context of the sentence. Delon Wright is a known professional American football player, not a hockey player. In football, a common play is \"pick and roll,\" not \"slashing.\" So mixing football terminology with hockey terminology in this context seems off.\n\nAdditionally, the phrase \"slashing\" is specific to hockey. In other sports like basketball or football, the term isn't used, so it doesn't make sense in this context.\n\nPutting this together, the sentence is inconsistent with real-world scenarios because it's mixing terms from hockey with football, and the term isn't applicable to a football player.

Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Kevin Durant is a professional basketball player. I know he's known for his defensive play, but I'm not sure about his offensive habits. I should check if it's common for him to commit fouls intentionally.\n\nIn basketball, committing a foul is a specific action that players sometimes take, especially when they're under pressure. Kevin Durant, being a strong player, might occasionally take a few fouls, but they're not the norm. I don't recall him committing an offensive foul intentionally. Instead, I think he's more focused on defense and plays with caution.\n\nSo, considering Kevin Durant's usual behavior, committing an offensive foul seems inconsistent and unlikely.

First, I know that Gardner Minshew is a professional football player who played for the New York Giants. He was a kick returner in the 2007 Super Bowl where the team lost 47-36 to the New York Giants. \n\nNow, the phrase \"safe at home\" in sports usually refers to being in a safe environment, like a safe play area or under a bench, which is a common occurrence in sports. It's not something you would hear every time a player is playing, but it's possible. So, while it's not guaranteed, it's plausible in a sports context.\n\nI should consider if there are any common mistakes or phrases used in sports. For example, in football, players might refer to being safe when they're not playing, but \"safe at home\" specifically sounds like it's about being in a safe place, which is a valid phrase. \n\nI don't see any reason why this sentence shouldn't be plausible, especially considering the context of a football game.

He's known for his ability to throw the ball through the air, which is a key skill in football. Now, the phrase \"shot from outside the eighteen\" is something I've heard in the context of basketball. In basketball, a player \"shot from outside the eighteen\" means they scored just before the game ended or the shot clock ran out.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Taylor Hall is a professional American football player. That means he's involved in football games, where the term \"shotree\" is used. In football, a 'shotree' refers to the last minute, high-stakes game where the outcome is determined by a coin toss. So, if Taylor Hall scored in that shootout, it would mean he scored in a crucial game where the team could potentially win or lose based on the coin toss.\n\nNow, is this a plausible scenario? Well, in football, every team plays many games, and players can perform exceptionally well in a game. It's not uncommon for a player to score in a shootout, especially if they're a star player. However, it's also possible that the game was close, and the player's performance was just good enough to make it to the shootout.\n\nI should also consider the context. If Taylor Hall scored in the shootout, it could indicate that he was performing exceptionally well, which is plausible for a top-tier football player. On the other hand, if the game was close and the player didn't score in the shootout, that would be less likely, but it's still possible.\n\nAnother thing to think about is whether this would be a common occurrence. In many sports, especially football, such events are common, but it's not guaranteed. So, while it's plausible in general, it's not guaranteed. However, the question doesn't ask for likelihood but rather plausibility, so it's acceptable for it to happen.\n\nIn conclusion, the sentence is plausible because it's a common occurrence in football where players can score in the shootout, especially if they perform exceptionally well.","full_output":"Okay, so I need to determine if the sentence \"Taylor Hall scored in the shootout\" is plausible.

He's played for teams like the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Giants, and the Denver Broncos. So, he definitely has experience in football.\n\nNext, the phrase \"went for it on fourth down.\" I'm pretty sure that's a standard football play. In football, when you're on the fourth down, you have to decide whether to go for it (go for it) or run for it (run for it). \"Go for it\" means you'll attempt to gain 10 yards or more, while \"run for it\" means you'll attempt to make 80-100 yards.

I think he's a big receiver, maybe a tight end or a running back. I should confirm his role in the team.\n\nNext, I should think about his typical behavior. When do they usually go back to the dugout? I believe they often come back to the end zone to signal to their coach or maybe to watch the game. So heading back to the dugout doesn't sound like something he's typically doing. It's more like a normal part of their routine rather than something unusual or intentional.\n\nI should also consider the context. Is this a real event? I don't recall him going back to the dugout frequently. It might be a rare occurrence, but it's not something that I've heard happening often. It's more plausible that he stays in the end zone or is in the field, not heading back.\n\nAnother angle is to think about the sports culture. In football, they often signal to their coach or the team leader, so heading back to the dugout could be seen as a bit of a strange or unorthodox action. It might be more of a casual thing rather than something that happens often.\n\nI should also consider if there's any historical context. Has there been any notable instances where a player went back to the dugout? I don't recall any major events involving Jesus Luzardo heading back to the dugout, so this seems unlikely.\n\nPutting it all together, the sentence doesn't seem plausible because it's unlikely that Jesus Luzardo would go back to the dugout.

Now, the World Series is a major baseball competition, typically held in the United States. It's a series of seven games played in each division, with the winner advancing to the National League series.\n\nA \"complete game\" would mean he pitched all seven innings without allowing a runner to get out.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is a professional American football player. He's known for his role as the quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys. So, if he's taking a side-step, that's a pretty unusual action in football because side steps are more common in basketball or soccer where players have to run or pass the ball. In football, players often run routes or make plays, but a side-step might not be standard.\n\nNext, the phrase \"three\" is mentioned. In basketball, \"three\" refers to making three-point shots. But in the context of a NBA Championship game, \"three\" would likely mean three points scored by a team or player. However, if the sentence is saying he took a side-step three, that doesn't quite make sense because \"three\" here isn't a multiple of three but rather a single action. It's more likely to be a mistake or a misphrase.\n\nPutting it all together, Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is a football player, and taking a side-step in a sports game where football is played seems impossible. The use of \"three\" in this context doesn't align with football terminology.

In basketball, when a team makes a shot, they say \"converted the basket.\" Similarly, in hockey, when a player makes a goal, they say \"converted the goal.\" So, in football, \"converted the first down\" doesn't make sense because there's no term like \"goal\" or \"goalie\" in football. The play they make is a run or a pass, not a conversion.\n\nI should also consider the context. If someone says \"converted the first down,\" they're probably referring to a successful play that led to the first down. But in football, the play itself is a run or pass, not a conversion.

He's a forward, so he's involved in the ice and plays hockey.\n\nNow, the phrase \"skated backwards\" – I know that in hockey, players can take penalty pictures, and sometimes they might show a penalty shot. A penalty shot is when the player shoots the puck at a goal that's already been blocked. The direction in which the shot is taken can be a bit tricky because it's not just about shooting from a specific point but about the angle and the player's stance.\n\nI think that \"skated backwards\" isn't a common or realistic action in real hockey. Typically, players take shots forward or from the right side, not backwards.

The phrase \"back shoulder fade\" is a term used in football to describe a specific play where the quarterback throws the ball to the end zone with a specific kind of arm movement, often resulting in a successful throw.\n\nNow, the sentence is suggesting that Jeudy caught this play.

A header goal, as I understood, is a different play where the ball is caught by the receiver after going through the defense.\n\nGiven that Ramires is described as a goalkeeper, it's unlikely he would score a header goal.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that Jamison Crowder is a professional running back in the NFL. So he's someone who plays football. Now, the sentence mentions a \"reverse layup.\" I'm not very familiar with this term, but I think it refers to a specific type of play in football where the quarterback throws the ball to a running back, and then the running back throws it forward. That seems like a pretty specific and unusual action, especially for a running back.\n\nI'm not sure if any running backs have ever scored a reverse layup. I don't recall hearing that term being used in any of their plays. It might be a term that's more commonly used in basketball or other sports. Since it's a football-related term and Crowder is a running back, it doesn't make sense for him to perform a reverse layup.\n\nI also think that in football, reverse layups aren't a common action.

Therefore, the sentence is not plausible.\n\nI should make sure I'm not missing anything here. Maybe I'm confusing it with another term, but I don't think so.

He's a left-handed pitcher who has had some notable moments in the game, including hitting for the record. So, he's a well-known figure in baseball.\n\nNow, the phrase \"stepped on first base\" is a specific action. In baseball, players hit the ball, and after that, they walk, which is moving to first base. So, stepping on first base would mean the player actually touched the base after walking.

Now, the sentence mentions \"caught the screen pass.\" I've heard the term \"screen pass\" before, but I'm not exactly sure what it means. \n\nI recall that in basketball, \"screen pass\" refers to a play where the offensive player shoots the ball while the defense is still trying to block. So, in basketball, you catch the screen pass when you score just before the game ends or the shot clock expires. \n\nBut the sentence is about Mitchell Trubisky, who plays football, not basketball.
