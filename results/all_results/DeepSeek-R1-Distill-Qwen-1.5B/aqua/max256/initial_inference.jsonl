Since the cube is 5 cm on each side and the thickness is 1 cm, the hollow part is 3 cm on each side. That means there's a layer of 1 cm on each side inside the hollow part.\n\nSo, the inner cube is 3x3x3 = 27 smaller cubes. These are completely inside the hollow part, so none of their faces are painted. Therefore, all 27 of these cubes have all their faces unpainted.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\nA)438\nB)550\nC)500\nD)450\nE)498\n\nNone of these options is 27.

The shopkeeper is giving a 20% discount on items for one day. On the other day, he needs to sell them at the original price. So, he needs to increase the price by some percentage to make up for the discount.\n\nFirst, let's assume the original price of an item is $100. A 20% discount would reduce the price to $80. So, he sells it for $80 on the first day. Now, he wants to sell it again at $100 on the other day. The question is, by what percentage does he need to increase $80 to get back to $100?\n\nTo find the percentage increase needed, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage Increase = (Increase in Price / Original Price) * 100%\n\nThe increase needed is $100 - $80 = $20.

If an item is discounted by 20%, the customer pays 80% of the original price. So, if an item originally costs $100, after a 20% discount, it would cost $80.\n\nNow, to make up for this $80, the shopkeeper needs to increase the price back to $100. The increase needed is $20 on a cost of $80. To find the percentage increase, I divide the increase by the discounted price and multiply by 100. So, ($20 / $80) * 100 = 25%. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure that this percentage applies to all items, not just one.

Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that for a quadratic equation of the form ax² + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots is -b/a and the product is c/a. In this equation, a is 1, b is m, and c is 22. So, if one of the roots is 1.5, let me call the other root r. Then, the sum of the roots is 1.5 + r, and the product is 1.5 * r.\n\nSince the product of the roots is 22, I can write:\n1.5 * r = 22\n\nTo find r, I can divide both sides by 1.5:\nr = 22 / 1.5\n\nHmm, calculating that, 22 divided by 1.5 is the same as 22 multiplied by 2/3, which is (22 * 2) / 3 = 44 /","predicted_answer":null,"ground_truth":"D","is_correct":null,"was_retried":true}

The goal is to maximize the number of trousers, so I should buy as many as possible within the Rs 810 budget.

I need to find the manufacturing cost per pen.\n\nOkay, first step is to determine how many pens are actually good and can be sold. Since 10% are defective, that means 90% are good. So, 7200 pens total, 10% defective is 720 pens. So, 7200 - 720 = 6480 pens are good.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total revenue from selling these 6480 pens at Rs. 10 each. That would be 6480 * 10 = Rs. 64,800.\n\nNow, the company makes a 25% profit on all the pens they made. Profit is calculated on the cost price.

Expanding this, it becomes x*(x² - 1), which simplifies to x³ - x. So, the equation we need to solve is x³ - x = 2184.\n\nTo find x, I can estimate it by taking the cube root of 2184. The cube root of 2184 is approximately 13, since 13³ is 2197, which is very close to","predicted_answer":null,"ground_truth":"E","is_correct":null,"was_retried":true}
