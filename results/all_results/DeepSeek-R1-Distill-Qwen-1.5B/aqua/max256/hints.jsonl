Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says that 75% of the employees take a winter vacation. Then, 40% take both winter and summer. 20% take neither. I need to find what percentage takes summer but not winter.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem involving sets and maybe some Venn diagrams. I remember from math class that when dealing with overlapping groups, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. \n\nLet me denote the total number of employees as 100% since percentages are involved. So, 75% take winter (let's call this set W), 40% take both winter and summer (let's call this set W ∩ S), and 20% take neither. That means 80% take at least one vacation, which is W ∪ S.\n\nI think the formula for the union of two sets is |W ∪ S| = |W| + |S| - |W ∩ S|.

Let me try to wrap my head around it step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem states that 75% of employees take a winter vacation. So, if I consider the total number of employees as 100%, 75% take winter, and 25% don't. But then it says 40% take both winter and summer. That means out of the 75% who take winter, 40% of those also take summer. \n\nWait, but the question is asking for the percentage of employees who take summer but not winter. So, I need to figure out how much of the summer vacation group is exclusive to summer, not winter. \n\nLet me think of it this way: If 75% take winter, and 40% of those also take summer, then the percentage of employees who take only winter is 75% - 40% = 35%. That means 35% take only winter. \n\nNow, since 20% take neither winter nor summer, the remaining percentage must be those who take summer but not winter. Let's add up the known percentages:\n\nOkay, let's break down the problem step by step. \n\nWe know that 75% of employees take winter vacation, and 40% take both winter and summer. So, the percentage of employees who take only winter is 75% - 40% = 35%. \n\nNext, we're told that 20% take neither vacation. \n\nSince the total percentage must add up to 100%, the remaining percentage must be those who take summer but not winter. \n\nSo, 100% - 35% (only winter) - 20% (neither) = 45% take summer only. \n\nTherefore, 45% of employees take summer but not winter.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{E}","ground_truth":"A","predicted_answer":"E","is_correct":false,"was_retried":true,"hint_sentence":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to write <MSK> hint for this problem.
