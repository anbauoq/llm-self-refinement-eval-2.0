So, we have employees taking winter, summer, both, or neither vacations. The percentages are:\n\n- 75% take winter.\n- 40% take both winter and summer.\n- 20% take neither.\n\nWe need to find the percentage who take summer only. \n\nFirst, I can think about the total percentage. If 75% take winter, and 40% take both, then the percentage taking only winter would be 75% - 40% = 35%. \n\nThen, the 20% who take neither are separate from both winter and summer. \n\nTo find the percentage taking summer only, I can subtract the percentages of those who take only winter and those who take neither from the total. So, 100% - 35% (winter only) - 20% (neither) = 45%. \n\nTherefore, 45% of employees take summer only but not winter.","full_output":"Okay, let's try to figure out this vacation problem. So, we have a company where 75% of employees take winter vacation, 40% take both winter and summer, and 20% take neither. We need to find out what percentage of employees take summer but not winter.\n\nHmm, first, I should visualize this. Maybe using a Venn diagram would help. Let me think. If 75% take winter, that's a large portion. Then 40% take both, so that's an overlap between winter and summer. And 20% take neither, which is separate from both.\n\nSo, if 75% take winter and 40% take both, the percentage taking only winter would be 75% - 40% = 35%. Similarly, 20% take neither, so the remaining percentage must be those who take summer only.\n\nLet me add up the percentages: 35% (winter only) + 40% (both) + 20% (neither) = 95%. That means 100% - 95% = 5% take summer only. Wait, that doesn't match the previous reasoning.\n\nOkay, let me try to figure out this vacation problem. So, we have employees taking winter, summer, both, or neither vacations.

Let me go through the problem step by step.\n\nThe store starts with 600 golf balls, all either yellow or white. By the end of the day, they've sold 80% of their inventory. So, 80% of 600 is 480 balls sold in total. \n\nThey sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, and all the white balls were sold. That means the number of white balls sold is equal to the number of yellow balls sold. Let me denote the number of white balls sold as W and the number of yellow balls sold as Y.

Let me go through the reasoning step by step.\n\nFirst, the store starts with 600 golf balls. By the end of the day, they've sold 80% of their inventory. Calculating 80% of 600 gives 480 balls sold in total. Since they sold an equal number of yellow and white balls, and all white balls were sold, this means the number of white balls sold equals the number of yellow balls sold.\n\nLet me denote the number of white balls sold as W and the number of yellow balls sold as Y. The problem states that W = Y. The total number of balls sold is W + Y, which equals 480. Substituting W with Y, we get 2Y = 480.
