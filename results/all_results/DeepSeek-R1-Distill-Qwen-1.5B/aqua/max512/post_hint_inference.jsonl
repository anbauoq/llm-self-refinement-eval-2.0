We need to form a bike number with 2 letters and 2 digits. The letters must be distinct, so each letter can only be used once. The digits can repeat, but I think the problem states they must be distinct as well, but the question specifically asks how many letters need to be distinct, so maybe that's not relevant.\n\nWait, no, the question is about how many letters need to be distinct, but the letters are being used in a number, so they have to be distinct by design. Maybe the letters can be the same, but the question is about how many distinct numbers can be formed, not how many unique letters are needed.\n\nSo, breaking it down:\n\n1. **Letters**: There are 26 letters in the alphabet. Since we need 2 letters and they must be distinct, the first letter has 26 options, and the second letter has 25 options (since it can't be the same as the first). So, the number of ways to choose the letters is 26 * 25 = 650 combinations.\n\n2. **Digits**: There are 10 digits (0-9). Since the digits can repeat, each digit position has 10 options. So, for two digits, it's 10 * 10 = 100 combinations.\n\n3. **Total combinations**: Multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of digit combinations.

So, there's a race with 5 horses, and Mr. Jain is betting on two horses he randomly selects. I need to find the probability that he picks the winning horse.\n\nFirst, I think I should determine how many possible ways there are to choose 2 horses out of 5. This is a combination problem because the order in which he selects the horses doesn't matter. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we're choosing.\n\nSo, plugging in the numbers, C(5, 2) = 5! / (2! * 3!) = (5 * 4 * 3!)/(2 * 1 * 3!) = (20)/2 = 10. There are 10 possible ways he can choose 2 horses.\n\nNext, I need to figure out how many of these combinations include the winning horse. If one of the horses is the winner, then the other horse can be any of the remaining 4 horses. So, there are 4 favorable combinations where the winning horse is included.\n\nTherefore, the probability that Mr. Jain selects the winning horse is the number of favorable combinations divided by the total number of combinations, which is 4/10. Simplifying that, it's 2/5.\n\nWait, but I'm a bit confused. Let me double-check. If there are 5 horses and he picks 2, the total number of possible pairs is indeed 10. The number of pairs that include the winning horse is 4 because he can pair the winning horse with each of the other 4 horses. So, 4 out of 10, which reduces to 2/5. That makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as the probability of picking the winning horse in the first selection and then any horse in the second, but since the order doesn't matter, it's still the same as the combination approach. So, I'm confident that the answer is 2/5, which is option B.","full_output":"Okay, let me try to figure this out.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the number of factors a number has is related to its prime factorization. If a number Q can be expressed as a product of primes raised to some powers, like Q = p₁^a * p₂^b * ... * p_n^k, then the total number of factors is (a+1)(b+1)...(k+1). \n\nSince Q has exactly 5 factors, the product of these (a+1)(b+1)...(k+1) must equal 5. Now, 5 is a prime number, so the only way to write 5 as a product of integers greater than 1 is 5 itself. That means there must be only one term in the product, which implies that Q must be a single prime raised to the 4th power because 4 + 1 = 5.\n\nSo, Q = p^4, where p is a prime number. \n\nNow, let's look at the statements:\n\nI.

So, the question is: If x is m percent of 4y, and we need to find what percentage m is of x. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, x is m percent of 4y. So, mathematically, that's x = (m/100) * 4y. Simplifying that, x = (4my)/100, which is the same as x = (my)/25.\n\nNow, we need to find what percentage m is of x. That means we're looking for a value p such that m = (p/100) * x. So, m = (p/100) * x.\n\nWe already have x in terms of m and y, so let's substitute that in. So, m = (p/100) * (my)/25. \n\nSimplifying the right side, we get m = (pm y)/(2500). \n\nNow, to solve for p, we can divide both sides by m y. That gives us 1 = (p)/(2500). So, p = 2500.\n\nWait, but that's just a number, not in terms of y. Hmm, maybe I misunderstood the question. Let me read it again.\n\nThe question says: \"m is what percentage of x?\" So, m is p percent of x, which is (p/100) * x = m.\n\nBut according to our calculation, p is 2500. That seems high. Let me check if I set up the equation correctly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for m as a percentage of x, so m = (p/100) * x. We found that p = 2500, so m = (2500/100) * x = 25x. But that would mean m is 25 times x, which doesn't make sense because x is m percent of 4y.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in substituting. Let me try another approach.\n\nWe have x = (4my)/100. We need m = (p/100) * x. So, substituting x, we get m = (p/100) * (4my)/100.\n\nSimplify\n\nOkay, so I have this problem here: \"If m > 0, y > 0, and x is m percent of 4y, then, in terms of y, m is what percentage of x?\"\n\nHmm, let me try to wrap my head around this. First, it says x is m percent of 4y. So, mathematically, that would be x = (m/100) * 4y. Simplifying that, x equals (4my)/100, which is the same as x = (my)/25.\n\nNow, the question is asking, in terms of y, what percentage is m of x. So, we need to find p such that m = (p/100) * x. That means m = (p/100) * x.\n\nBut wait, we already have x in terms of m and y, which is x = (my)/25. So, substituting that into the equation, we get m = (p/100) * (my)/25.\n\nLet me simplify that. So, m = (p/100) * (my)/25. The y's might cancel out, but let's see. The m's also cancel on both sides, so we have 1 = (p/100) * y/25.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. We have p in terms of y, but the question asks for p in terms of y. But according to this, p would be (100 * 25)/y, which is 2500/y. That seems a bit odd because it suggests that as y increases, p decreases, which doesn't make much sense in this context.\n\nMaybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back. The original equation is x = (m/100) * 4y, so x = (4my)/100 = (my)/25. Then, we're looking for p such that m = (p/100) * x. Substituting x, m = (p/100) * (my)/25.\n\nSimplifying, m = (p * my) / (25 * 100) = (p * my)/2500. Now, to solve for p, divide both sides by (my)/2500, which gives p\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step.
