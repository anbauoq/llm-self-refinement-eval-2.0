I need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\nAlright, let me break this down step by step. First, I need to visualize the situation. There's a vertical tower, and the car is moving towards the base along a straight line. At the first point, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and after 10 minutes, it's 60 degrees. The car's speed is constant, so I can use trigonometry to find the distances involved.\n\nLet's denote the height of the tower as H. When the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, the distance from the car to the base of the tower (let's call this D1) can be found using the tangent function. Since tan(45°) = 1, we have:\n\ntan(45°) = opposite / adjacent = H / D1\n\nSo, D1 = H.\n\nSimilarly, when the angle becomes 60 degrees, the distance from the car to the base of the tower is D2. Using tan(60°) = √3, we have:\n\ntan(60°) = H / D2\n\nSo, D2 = H / √3.\n\nThe car moves from D1 to D2 in 10 minutes, which is the time it takes to cover the distance D1 - D2.

The probability that neither A nor B increases is the same as the probability that both A and B do not increase. So, I think we can use the principle that P(neither) = 1 - P(A or B). \n\nNow, P(A or B) is the probability that either A or B increases. To find this, I think we need to consider the probabilities of A and B individually and then subtract the probability that both occur to avoid double-counting. So, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). \n\nWait, but the problem doesn't give us the joint probability P(A and B). Hmm, is there a way to find that?

We have two stocks, A and B, with probabilities of increasing in value given as 0.56 and 0.74, respectively.

Under independence, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.56 * 0.74 = 0.4144.\n\nNow, plugging these into the inclusion-exclusion formula:\nP(A or B) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.4144 = 0.8856.\n\nTherefore, the probability that neither stock increases is:\nP(neither) = 1 - 0.8856 = 0.1144.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\nA) 0.22\nB) 0.26\nC) 0.37\nD) 0.46\nE) 0.63\n\n0.1144 isn't listed, which suggests that assuming independence might not be the correct approach. Maybe the events are not independent, or perhaps we need to consider the maximum possible probability of neither event occurring, which would occur when the joint probability P(A and B) is as high as possible.\n\nTo maximize P(neither), we need to minimize P(A or B), which happens when P(A and B) is maximized. The maximum P(A and B) can be is min(P(A), P(B)) = min(0.56, 0.74) = 0.56.\n\nSo, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.56 = 0.74.\n\nTherefore, P(neither) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.\n\nOkay, let's tackle this probability problem.

None of these options is 120. That doesn't match. Maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nLet me read it again. It says the profit is on the selling price, which is $100 per bag. So, profit per bag is 25% of 100, which is 25. Total profit is 3000, so number of bags is 3000 ÷ 25 = 120. Still 120.

But the problem doesn't provide that information. So, I think it's more likely that it's 25% profit on selling price, which is $25 per bag.\n\nWait, maybe the profit is calculated differently.

A student instead of finding 7/8 of a number, he found 7/18 of the same number. His answer was different from the actual one by 770.

The student was supposed to calculate 7/8 of a number but instead calculated 7/18 of it. The difference between these two results is 770. So, I need to set up an equation where the difference between 7/18 of the number and 7/8 of the number equals 770.\n\nLet me denote the original number as 'x'. Then, the correct value should be (7/8)x, and the student calculated (7/18)x. The difference between these two is 770. So, I can write the equation as:\n\n(7/18)x - (7/8)x = 770\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. To do that, I'll first find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 18 and 8, so the least common multiple is 72. I'll rewrite both fractions with denominator 72:\n\n(7/18)x = (28/72)x\n(7/8)x = (63/72)x\n\nSubtracting these gives:\n\n(28/72)x - (63/72)x = (28 - 63)/72 x = (-35/72)x\n\nSo, (-35/72)x = 770\n\nTo solve for x, I'll multiply both sides by 72 and then divide by -35:\n\nx = 770 * 72 / (-35)\n\nWait, that can't be right because the result should be positive. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs.

The problem says the student's answer differed from the actual one by 770. It doesn't specify which one is larger, so I need to consider both possibilities.\n\nBut in this case, since 7/18 is less than 7/8, the student's answer would be smaller than the actual value, so the difference would be negative. But since we're dealing with absolute value, the difference is 770.\n\nSo, let's write the equation as:\n\n(7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770\n\nTo solve this, I need to find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 8 and 18, so the least common multiple is 72.\n\nConvert the fractions:\n\n(7/8)x = (63/72)x\n(7/18)x = (28/72)x\n\nSubtracting these:\n\n(63/72)x - (28/72)x = (63 - 28)/72 x = 35/72 x\n\nSo, 35/72 x = 770\n\nTo find x, I can multiply both sides by 72 and then divide by 35:\n\nx = 770 * (72 / 35)\n\nNow, let's compute 770 divided by 35 first. 3\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this problem where a student was supposed to find 7/8 of a number but instead found 7/18 of it, and the difference between the correct answer and the student's answer is 770.

So, we have an airplane flying around a square field with sides at different speeds: 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr.

Let's call the length of one side 's'. So, the total distance the plane flies is 4s.\n\nNow, for each side, I need to calculate the time it takes to fly that side at the given speed. \n\nTime is equal to distance divided by speed.

Let me call the length of each side 's'. That way, I can work with variables instead of specific numbers. \n\nThe airplane flies each side at different speeds: 200, 400, 600, and 800 km/hr. Since it's flying around the square, the total distance it covers is 4 times the length of one side.

Since Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, its rate is 1 pool per 8 hours, or 1/8 of the pool per hour.\n\nNow, for the first 2 hours, only Hose A is working, so it fills 2 * (1/8) = 2/8 = 1/4 of the pool.\n\nAfter that, both hoses work together for 3 hours. Let's call Hose B's rate 1/B pools per hour. So together, their combined rate is (1/8 + 1/B) pools per hour.\n\nIn 3 hours, they fill 3 * (1/8 + 1/B) of the pool. Since the total pool is 1, we can set up the equation:\n\n1/4 + 3*(1/8 + 1/B) = 1\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n1/4 + 3/8 + 3/B = 1\n\nCombining the fractions:\n\n1/4 is 2/8, so 2/8 + 3/8 = 5/8\n\nSo 5/8 + 3/B = 1\n\nSubtracting 5/8 from both sides:\n\n3/B = 3/8\n\nSo B must be 8 hours.

It says there are equal numbers of 25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee coins. I need to find out how many of each there are. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the values of the coins. I know that 1 rupee is equal to 100 paise, right? So, each 1 rupee coin is worth 100 paise. The 25 paise coin is just 25 paise, and the 50 paise coin is 50 paise. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the problem says there are an equal number of each coin. Let's say there are 'n' number of each type. So, there are 'n' 25 paise coins, 'n' 50 paise coins, and 'n' 1 rupee coins. That means the total number of coins is 3n.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the total amount of money. Since the total amount is Rs. 700, I should convert that into paise because the coin values are in paise. I know that 1 rupee is 100 paise, so 700 rupees would be 700 * 100 = 70,000 paise.\n\nOkay, so the total amount in paise is 70,000. Now, let's express the total amount in terms of 'n'. Each 25 paise coin contributes 25 paise, so n coins would be 25n paise. Similarly, each 50 paise coin is 50 paise, so that's 50n paise. And each 1 rupee coin is 100 paise, so that's 100n paise.\n\nAdding all these up gives the total amount in paise:\n\n25n + 50n + 100n = 70,000\n\nLet me simplify this equation.

It seems like a tempo is a collection or group of items, so each tempo has 98 boxes.\n\nEach box contains 5 dozen toys. Since one dozen is 12, 5 dozen would be 5 * 12 = 60 toys per box.\n\nNow, if each tempo has 98 boxes, then the number of toys per tempo is 60 toys/box * 98 boxes. Let me calculate that:\n\n60 * 98.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. \n\nI remember that when we're choosing items from a set without considering the order, it's a combination problem. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we're choosing. \n\nIn this case, n is 10 because there are 10 oranges, and k is 2 since we're choosing 2 oranges.

The catch is, Brown goes on vacation after working for 8 days, and then Black starts working for 6 days. I need to figure out how many days it will take for Blue to finish the remaining work. \n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, I should figure out how much each person can paint in the time they're working. \n\nStarting with Brown: he can paint a house in 6 days, so in one day, he paints 1/6 of a house. If he works for 8 days, he'll paint 8 * (1/6) = 8/6 = 1 and 2/3 houses. Wait, 8/6 simplifies to 1 and 2/3. That seems right because 6 days make a house, so 8 days would be a little over one house.\n\nNext, Black starts working after Brown leaves. He can paint a house in 8 days, so in one day, he paints 1/8 of a house. If he works for 6 days, he'll paint 6 * (1/8) = 6/8 = 3/4 of a house. 3/4 is 0.75, which is less than a house but more than a half.\n\nSo far, after 8 days of Brown working and 6 days of Black working, how much of the contract has been painted?

The cube is hollow with a thickness of 1 cm, and it's made up of 1 cm cubes. The outer surface is painted, and we're supposed to find the number of unpainted faces.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find the total number of small cubes on the surface. The cube is 5 cm on each side, so there are 5x5x5=125 small cubes in total. Since it's hollow, the inner cube is 3x3x3=27 small cubes that aren't painted. So, the number of surface cubes is 125 - 27 = 98.\n\nNow, each small cube on the surface has some painted faces. The cubes on the edges and corners will have more painted faces. Let's categorize the cubes based on their positions: corners, edges, faces, and inner cubes.\n\nThere are 8 corner cubes, each with 3 painted faces. Each corner is shared by three faces. Then, on each edge, excluding the corners, there are 3 - 2 = 1 cube per edge, so there are 12 edges in a cube, making 12 cubes with 2 painted faces each. \n\nOn each face, excluding the edges, there are (5-2)x(5-2)=3x3=9 cubes, but we've already counted the edges, so 9 - 4 = 5 cubes per face with 1 painted face.

The cubes on the edges are counted as having 2 painted faces, but","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many faces of the small cubes remain unpainted after the outer surface is painted. The cube is hollow with a thickness of 1 cm, and it's made up of 1 cm cubes. The outer surface is painted, and we're supposed to find the number of unpainted faces.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find the total number of small cubes on the surface. The cube is 5 cm on each side, so there are 5x5x5=125 small cubes in total. Since it's hollow, the inner cube is 3x3x3=27 small cubes that aren't painted. So, the number of surface cubes is 125 - 27 = 98.\n\nNow, each small cube on the surface has some painted faces. The cubes on the edges and corners will have more painted faces. Let's categorize the cubes based on their positions: corners, edges, faces, and inner cubes.\n\nThere are 8 corner cubes, each with 3 painted faces. Each corner is shared by three faces. Then, on each edge, excluding the corners, there are 3 - 2 = 1 cube per edge, so there are 12 edges in a cube, making 12 cubes with 2 painted faces each. \n\nOn each face, excluding the edges, there are (5-2)x(5-2)=3x3=9 cubes, but we've already counted the edges, so 9 - 4 = 5 cubes per face with 1 painted face. With 6 faces, that's 6*5=30 cubes with 1 painted face each.\n\nAdding these up: 8 (corners) + 12 (edges) + 30 (faces) = 50 cubes with at least one painted face.

So, his batting average is 51, which means after some matches, his average is 51. In the finals, he scores 78 runs, and his new average becomes 54. I need to find the total number of matches he played this season.\n\nFirst, I remember that batting average is calculated as total runs divided by the number of matches. So, if his average went from 51 to 54 after scoring 78 runs, I can set up some equations.\n\nLet me denote the number of matches he played before the finals as 'x'. His total runs before the finals would then be 51 * x. After playing one more match (the finals), his total runs become 51x + 78, and the number of matches becomes x + 1.

Let's call the breadth (width) of the rectangle 'b'. Then, the length would be 4 times the breadth plus 1 meter.

That gives me:\n\n3*(3P) = 5B\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\n9P = 5B\n\nNow, I can solve for B in terms of P:\n\nB = (9/5)P\n\nSo, one baguette is equal to 1.8 pita breads.\n\nThe question is asking how many pita breads are equivalent to two baguettes. So, if one baguette is 1.8 pita breads, then two baguettes would be:\n\n2B = 2*(9/5)P = (18/5)P = 3.6P\n\nHmm, 3.6 pita breads. But the answer choices are all whole numbers. 3.6 is the same as 18/5, which is 3 and 3/5. But looking at the options, option C is 3 and option D is 2. That doesn't match exactly.\n\nWait, maybe I should check if I interpreted the problem correctly.

So, we're given that the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person. We need to find the train fare for one person when a total of 6 persons take the bus and 8 take the train, totaling Rs.1512.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make it easier. Let me denote the train fare for one person as T. According to the problem, the bus fare for two persons is (4/3) times the train fare for one person. So, if the train fare is T, then the bus fare for two people is (4/3)T.\n\nNow, we have 6 persons taking the bus and 8 taking the train. The total fare for the bus would be 6 times the bus fare for two persons.

Looking at the options, that's option A.","full_output":"Okay, so I have this problem where the average weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. Then a new heavy-duty truck is added, and the average weight increases by 2.6 tons. I need to find the weight of the truck.\n\nFirst, let me find the total weight of the original 10 vehicles. Since the average is 12.2 tons, the total weight is 10 * 12.2. Let me calculate that: 10 * 12.2 is 122 tons.\n\nNow, after adding the truck, the average increases by 2.6 tons, so the new average is 12.2 + 2.6, which is 14.8 tons. There are now 11 vehicles in total because we added one truck.\n\nTo find the total weight of all 11 vehicles, I multiply the new average by the number of vehicles: 11 * 14.8. Let me compute that: 11 * 14 is 154, and 11 * 0.8 is 8.8, so total is 154 + 8.8 = 162.8 tons.\n\nThe difference between the total weight of the 11 vehicles and the original 10 vehicles will be the weight of the truck. So, 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The original total was 122 tons, and with the truck, it's 162.8 tons. So yes, 162.8 minus 122 is indeed 40.8 tons. So the truck weighs 40.8 tons. That's option A.\n\nI think that's right. Let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. 10 * 12.2 is definitely 122. 11 * 14.8: 10 * 14.8 is 148, plus 14.8 is 162.8. 162.8 minus 122 is 40.8. Yep, that looks correct.\n</think>\n\nThe total weight of the original 10 vehicles is 122 tons. After adding the truck, the average weight increases to 14.8\n\nOkay, so I have this problem here about average weights of vehicles. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nSo, initially, there are 10 vehicles, and their average weight is 12.2 tons. That means the total weight of all 10 vehicles together is 10 times 12.2 tons. Let me calculate that:\n\n10 vehicles * 12.2 tons/vehicle = 122 tons.\n\nNow, a new heavy-duty truck is added, making the total number of vehicles 11. The average weight of all the vehicles, including the truck, increases by 2.6 tons. So, the new average weight is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.\n\nWith 11 vehicles now, the total weight becomes 11 * 14.8 tons. Let me compute that:\n\n11 vehicles * 14.8 tons/vehicle = 162.8 tons.\n\nTo find the weight of the truck, I subtract the original total weight from the new total weight:\n\n162.8 tons - 122 tons = 40.8 tons.\n\nSo, the truck must weigh 40.8 tons. Looking at the options, that's option A.\n</think>\n\nThe average weight of the 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons, so the total weight is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons. After adding the truck, the average increases to 14.8 tons for 11 vehicles, so the total weight becomes 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons. The truck's weight is the difference: 162.8 - 122 = 40.8 tons.\n\n\\boxed{A}","ground_truth":"A","predicted_answer":"A","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says that a square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge. So, if the original side length of the square is 's', trimming 4 feet from one edge would make the new rectangle have dimensions (s - 4) by s. That makes sense because one side is shorter by 4 feet, and the other side remains the same.\n\nNext, this rectangle is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. Each of these triangles has an area of 70 square feet. Since the rectangle is cut diagonally, each triangle will have half the area of the rectangle.

I need to find its new length after this reduction.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the ratio 5:3 means in this context. Ratios can be a bit confusing, so I want to make sure I interpret it correctly. Ratios are about parts to parts, so if the ribbon is being reduced in the ratio 5:3, it could mean that the reduction is 5 parts, and the remaining length is 3 parts.\n\nSo, if the original length is 30 cm, and the ratio is 5:3, then the total number of parts is 5 + 3 = 8 parts.

Ratios are about parts to parts, so if the ribbon is being reduced in the ratio 5:3, it could mean that the reduction is 5 parts, and the remaining length is 3 parts.\n\nSo, if the original length is 30 cm, and the ratio is 5:3, then the total number of parts is 5 + 3 = 8 parts. Each part would then be 30 cm divided by 8, which is 3.75 cm. \n\nNow, the reduction is 3 parts, so 3 multiplied by 3.75 cm equals 11.25 cm. \n\nTherefore, the new length of the ribbon would be the original length minus the reduction: 30 cm - 11.25 cm = 18.75 cm. \n\nLooking at the options provided:\nA)18\nB)30\nC)6\nD)15\nE)12\n\n18.75 cm isn't listed, but 18 cm is option A, which is the closest whole number. It's possible that the options are rounded or approximate. Alternatively, maybe there's a different way to interpret the ratio.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio 5:3 is about the remaining length, not the reduction. So, if the ribbon is being reduced in the ratio 5:3, maybe that means the remaining length is 5 parts, and the reduction is 3 parts. That way, the total parts would be 5 + 3 = 8 parts.\n\nSo, the original length is 30 cm, and each part is 30 cm divided by 8, which is 3.75 cm. The reduction would be 3 parts, so 3 multiplied by 3.75 cm equals 11.25 cm.\n\nTherefore, the new length would be 5 parts (remaining) minus 3 parts (reduction): 5 * 3.75 cm - 3 * 3.75 cm","predicted_answer":null,"ground_truth":"A","is_correct":null,"was_retried":true}

Similarly, N is the reverse, so it's 100c + 10b + a.\n\nThe problem states that M is greater than N, so 100a + 10b + c > 100c + 10b + a.

Now, we need to find the bill when 500 calls are made.\n\nFirst, I think we can set up two equations based on the given information. Let's denote the fixed cost as 'F' and the variable cost per call as 'C'. So, for the first month, the total bill would be F + 540*C = 1800. For the second month, it's F + 620*C = 2040.\n\nNow, we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate F. That gives us (F + 620C) - (F + 540C) = 2040 - 1800. Simplifying this, it's 80C = 240. So, solving for C, we get C = 240 / 80 = 3 Rs per call.\n\nNow that we know the variable cost is 3 Rs per call, we can plug this back into the first equation to find F. So, F + 540*3 = 1800.

For the second month, it's F + 620*C = 2040.\n\nNow, we can subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate F. That gives us (F + 620C) - (F + 540C) = 2040 - 1800. Simplifying this, it's 80C = 240. So, solving for C, we get C = 240 / 80 = 3 Rs per call.\n\nNow that we know the variable cost is 3 Rs per call, we can plug this back into the first equation to find F. So, F + 540*3 = 1800. Calculating 540*3 gives 1620, so F = 1800 - 1620 = 180 Rs.\n\nNow, we can calculate the bill for 500 calls. That would be F + 500*C = 180 + 500*3 = 180 + 1500 = 1680 Rs.\n\nSo, the correct answer should be B) Rs.1680.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{B}","ground_truth":"B","predicted_answer":"B","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

For Ball A, it's 2 rotations in 26 minutes, so one rotation would take 26 divided by 2, which is 13 minutes. So, Ball A takes 13 minutes per rotation.\n\nFor Ball B, it's 5 rotations in 35 minutes.

There are 30 hardcover books and 20 fiction books. I'm trying to find the maximum overlap between these two groups—books that are both hardcover and fiction. \n\nI remember something about sets and overlapping elements. There's a formula for the maximum possible overlap between two sets. It goes like this: the maximum overlap is the smaller of the two individual set sizes, but it can't exceed the total number of elements in the universal set. \n\nIn this case, the universal set is the total number of books, which is 45. The two sets are hardcover books (30) and fiction books (20). The smaller of these two is 20, so the maximum overlap can't be more than 20. But wait, is that the case?\n\nLet me think again. If I try to maximize the number of books that are both hardcover and fiction, I should consider how many fiction books I can have that are also hardcover. Since there are only 20 fiction books, and if all of them are also hardcover, that would mean 20 books are both. But I have 30 hardcover books in total. So, if I have 20 fiction books that are also hardcover, that leaves 30 - 20 = 10 hardcover books that are not fiction. \n\nDoes this make sense? Let me double-check. If I have 20 books that are both hardcover and fiction, and 10 books that are only hardcover, then the total number of books would be 20 + 10 = 30 hardcover books, which matches the given number. Additionally, the fiction books would be 20, which is the total fiction count. \n\nSo, adding the non-fiction hardcover books, that's 10 + 20 = 30, and the remaining 15 books are non-hardcover but fiction? Wait, no.

A square has four sides of equal length, so each side length S can be found by dividing the perimeter by 4. That is, S = P / 4. Substituting the perimeter we found, S = 88 cm / 4 = 22 cm.

Ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I remember that ratios compare quantities. So, the ratio 3:4 means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets. \n\nGiven that there are 120 green sweets, I can think of this as 4 parts of the ratio being equal to 120 sweets.

I need to figure out how much money John originally had. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, Mark says that if John gives him half his money, he'll have Rs.75. Let's call John's original amount of money \"J\". If John gives half of that, which is J/2, to Mark, then Mark's total becomes J/2 + J/2 = J, and John's total becomes J/2. According to Mark, John would have Rs.75 after this exchange. So, J/2 = 75. Solving for J, I multiply both sides by 2, and I get J = 150. So, John must have had Rs.150 originally.\n\nBut let me double-check this. If John has Rs.150 and gives half, which is Rs.75, to Mark, then Mark would receive Rs.75.

I remember the formula for the area of a trapezium is (a + b)/2 * h, where a and b are the lengths of the two parallel sides, and h is the height (which in this case would be the depth of the canal). \n\nSo, plugging in the values I have: (10 + 6)/2 * h = 640. Let me calculate that step by step. 10 plus 6 is 16, divided by 2 is 8. So, 8 * h equals 640. To find h, I divide both sides by 8: h = 640 / 8. That gives me h = 80 meters. Wait, that seems really deep for a canal. Let me double-check my calculations. 10 + 6 is 16, divided by 2 is 8, times h equals 640. Yeah, 8 times 80 is 640, so h must be 80 meters. Hmm, but that's a lot deeper than I expected. Maybe I made a mistake somewhere, but I can't see where. Let me try another approach. If the area is 640, and the average of the two widths is 8 meters, then 8 * h must equal 640. That still gives h = 80.

We're supposed to find the ratio of zinc to copper in the final alloy Z, which is made by melting 40 grams of Alloy X and 60 grams of Alloy Y.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ratios. For Alloy X, the ratio is 6:9 for zinc to copper. That means for every 6 parts of zinc, there are 9 parts of copper. Similarly, Alloy Y has a ratio of 7:11 for zinc to copper. So, for every 7 parts of zinc, there are 11 parts of copper.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the amount of zinc and copper from each alloy. Since we're mixing 40 grams of Alloy X and 60 grams of Alloy Y, I'll calculate the zinc and copper from each separately.\n\nStarting with Alloy X:\n- The ratio is 6:9, which can be simplified to 2:3.\n- For 40 grams of Alloy X, the total parts are 2 + 3 = 5 parts.\n- Zinc in Alloy X: (6/5) * 40 = 48 grams.\n- Copper in Alloy X: (9/5) * 40 = 72 grams.\n\nWait, let me verify that.

For Alloy X, the ratio is 6:9 for zinc to copper. That means for every 6 parts of zinc, there are 9 parts of copper. Similarly, Alloy Y has a ratio of 7:11 for zinc to copper. So, for every 7 parts of zinc, there are 11 parts of copper.\n\nNext, I need to calculate the amount of zinc and copper from each alloy. Since we're mixing 40 grams of Alloy X and 60 grams of Alloy Y, I'll calculate the zinc and copper from each separately.\n\nStarting with Alloy X:\n- The ratio is 6:9, which can be simplified to 2:3.\n- For 40 grams of Alloy X, the total parts are 2 + 3 = 5 parts.\n- Zinc in Alloy X: (6/5) * 40 = 48 grams.\n- Copper in Alloy X: (9/5) * 40 = 72 grams.\n\nWait, let me verify that.

The question is about finding the number of employees in an organization that aims to raise Rs. 6 lakh through equal contributions.

Let N be the number of employees and C be the original contribution per employee. The total amount collected initially is 60,000, so:\n\nN * C = 60,000\n\nIf each employee contributed Rs. 60 extra, the new contribution per employee would be C + 60, and the total would be 62,400 (since 60,000 + 2,400 = 62,400).

If each contributed Rs. 60 extra, the new contribution per employee is 1,560, and the total is 40 * 1,560 = 62,400, which matches the given information. Therefore, the correct answer is 40 employees.","full_output":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many employees are in this organization. Let's see, the problem says the organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contributions from each employee. If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the total contribution would have been Rs. 6.24 lakh. I need to find the number of employees.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Let's denote the number of employees as N. The original contribution per employee would be Total amount / N, which is 60,000 / N. If each contributed Rs. 60 extra, the new total contribution would be 60,000 + 60,000 * (60 / 100) because 60% more than 60,000 is 60,000 * 1.6 = 96,000. Wait, no, that doesn't make sense because 60 extra per employee would be 60 * N. So the total contribution would be 60,000 + 60 * N = 62,400. \n\nWait, let me rephrase that. The original total is 60,000. If each of the N employees contributes an extra 60, the total becomes 60,000 + 60*N. This equals 62,400. So, 60,000 + 60N = 62,400. Subtracting 60,000 from both sides gives 60N = 2,400. Dividing both sides by 60 gives N = 2,400 / 60 = 40. \n\nWait, that seems low. Let me check again. If N is 40, each employee contributes 60, so total is 40 * 60 = 2,400. Adding that to 60,000 gives 62,400, which matches the problem statement. So the number of employees is 40. Looking at the options, option C is 400, which is much higher. Did I make a mistake?\n\nWait, maybe I misinterpreted the problem. Let me try another approach. Let’s denote the original contribution as C. So, N\n\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step.

So, we have 5,000 voters, but 20% aren't eligible to vote.

Out of these, 20% are not eligible to vote. So, I need to find out how many voters are actually eligible. \n\nTo calculate the number of eligible voters, I'll subtract 20% of 5,000 from the total. That would be 5,000 minus 20% of 5,000. \n\n20% of 5,000 is 0.2 * 5,000 = 1,000. So, the number of eligible voters is 5,000 - 1,000 = 4,000 voters.\n\nNext, the winning candidate won by 15% of the total votes. Wait, no, the question says the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes, but I need to clarify: is this 15% of the total eligible voters or 15% of the total votes cast?\n\nHmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous. It says, \"The winning candidate won by 15% of the votes.\" Since the eligible voters are only 4,000, maybe it's 15% of the total eligible voters. Let me proceed with that assumption for now.\n\nSo, 15% of 4,000 is 0.15 * 4,000 = 600 votes. \n\nThis means the winning candidate received 600 more votes than the other candidate. Let me denote the votes for the winning candidate as W and the other as L. So, W = L + 600.\n\nSince the total votes are 4,000, we have W + L = 4,000. Substituting W, we get (L + 600) + L = 4,000. \n\nCombining like terms: 2L + 600 = 4,000. Subtracting 600 from both sides: 2L = 3,400.

Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, there are 5,000 voters in total, but 20% of them aren't eligible to vote. So, I need to find out how many voters actually can vote. \n\n20% of 5,000 is 1,000, right? Because 10% is 500, so 20% would be double that. So, 5,000 minus 1,000 gives me 4,000 eligible voters. That makes sense.\n\nNow, the winning candidate won by 15% of the votes. Hmm, I'm not sure if that means 15% of the total eligible voters or 15% of the total votes cast. I think it's 15% of the total eligible voters because that's what the question is asking for. \n\nSo, 15% of 4,000 eligible voters is 600 votes. That means the winning candidate got 600 more votes than the other candidate. \n\nLet me call the votes for the winning candidate \"W\" and the other candidate \"L\". So, W = L + 600. \n\nSince there are 4,000 eligible voters in total, W + L = 4,000. \n\nSubstituting W from the first equation into the second: (L + 600) + L = 4,000. \n\nCombining like terms: 2L + 600 = 4,000. \n\nSubtracting 600 from both sides: 2L = 3,400. \n\nDividing both sides by 2: L = 1,700. \n\nSo, the other candidate got 1,700 votes, and the winning candidate got 1,700 + 600 = 2,300 votes. \n\nLooking at the options provided: A)3267, B)2678, C)2797, D)2300, E)2781. \n\n2,300 is option D.

When he runs to the school, his speed is 10 mph, so the time taken for this part is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_{\\text{run}} = \\frac{d}{10} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nThen, when he walks back home, his speed is 5 mph, so the time taken for this part is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Time}_{\\text{walk}} = \\frac{d}{5} \\text{ hours}\n\\]\n\nSince the total time for both trips is one hour, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{10} + \\frac{d}{5} = 1\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( d \\), I'll first find a common denominator for the fractions. The denominators are 10 and 5, so the common denominator is 10. I can rewrite \\( \\frac{d}{5} \\) as \\( \\frac{2d}{10} \\) to have the same denominator as \\( \\frac{d}{10} \\).\n\nNow, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{d}{10} + \\frac{2d}{10} = 1\n\\]\n\nAdding the numerators together:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3d}{10} = 1\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( d \\), I'll multiply both sides by 10:\n\n\\[\n3d = 10\n\\]\n\nThen, I'll divide both sides by 3:\n\n\\[\nd = \\frac{10}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo, the distance from his home to his school is \\( \\","predicted_answer":null,"ground_truth":"D","is_correct":null,"was_retried":true}

But the original question says 25/12*5, which is ambiguous. \n\nWait, maybe I should consider the order of operations more carefully. In mathematics, multiplication and division are performed from left to right. So, 25/12*5 should be calculated as (25/12)*5, not 25/(12*5). That would give me approximately 10.4165, which is still not among the options. \n\nLet me check the options again to see if I missed something. Option D is 8.5497, which is close to 8.55.

Train N leaves City B at 7 am and arrives at City A at 10:30 am, which is 3.5 hours.\n\nFirst, I need to find the speeds of both trains. Since speed is distance divided by time, and assuming the distance between City A and City B is the same for both trains, let's call that distance D. \n\nTrain M's speed would be D divided by 4 hours, so that's D/4.

Therefore, each roll covers \\( 0.5 \\times l \\) m².\n\nThe total area covered by all the rolls is \\( \\text{number of rolls} \\times 0.5 \\times l \\). But I don't know the number of rolls or \\( l \\). Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the total area covered by the rolls is equal to the total wall area minus the 15 m² for doors and windows. So:\n\n\\( \\text{Total wall area} - 15 = \\text{Total area covered by rolls} \\)\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\( \\frac{4}{5}s^2 - 15 = \\text{Total area covered by rolls} \\)\n\nBut I still have two variables here: \\( s \\) and the number of rolls.

After removing 'x' kg, the remaining mixture is 10 - x kg, with 3 - 0.3x kg of sand and 7 - 0.7x kg of clay.\n\nThen, I add 'x' kg of pure sand, so the total sand becomes (3 - 0.3x) + x = 3 + 0.7x kg. The clay remains at 7 - 0.7x kg because I didn't remove any clay.\n\nI want the sand to be equal to the clay, so I set up the equation:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\nSolving for x:\n\n3 + 0.7x = 7 - 0.7x\n\n0.7x + 0.7x = 7 - 3\n\n1.4x = 4\n\nx = 4 / 1.4 ≈ 2.857 kg\n\nBut the options are all in fractions.

Because 30% of 10kg is 3kg, and 70% is 7kg.\n\nNow, the goal is to make the mixture have equal amounts of sand and clay. Since the total is 10kg, equal parts would mean 5kg sand and 5kg clay.

So, we have the conditions x < 0, y > 0, and |x³| > |y²|.

The absolute value of x cubed is greater than the absolute value of y squared.\n\nSince both x and y are positive and negative respectively, let's rewrite the third condition without the absolute value. The absolute value of x³ is |x³|, which is the same as (-x)³ because x is negative. So, |x³| = (-x)³ = -x³ since x is negative. Similarly, |y²| is just y² because y² is always positive.\n\nSo, the condition becomes -x³ > y².\n\nNow, let's think about what this tells us. Since x is negative, -x is positive.

Let's rearrange the inequality:\n\n-x³ > y²  \nMultiply both sides by -1 (remembering to reverse the inequality sign):  \nx³ < -y²  \nTake the cube root of both sides:  \nx < -y^(2/3)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach. Let's think about the magnitudes. Since |x³| > |y²|, the magnitude of x³ is greater than the magnitude of y². So, |x|³ > |y|².\n\nBut x is negative, so |x| = -x. Similarly, y is positive, so |y| = y.\n\nSo, (-x)³ > y²  \nWhich simplifies to -x³ > y².\n\nLet me consider the signs. x is negative, so -x is positive. y is positive, so y² is positive.

So, I need to find the selling price per unit (let's call it P) such that the total revenue (which is P multiplied by the number of units sold, 5040) minus the total cost ($554,400) is at least $626,400.\n\nLet me set up the equation:\n\nRevenue - Cost ≥ Profit  \n5040P - 554,400 ≥ 626,400\n\nNow, I'll solve for P:\n\n5040P ≥ 626,400 + 554,400  \n5040P ≥ 1,180,800  \nP ≥ 1,180,800 / 5040  \nP ≥ 234.3\n\nSo, the selling price per component needs to be at least $234.3 to ensure a profit of at least $626,400.

To find the time until they meet, I can divide the distance by their combined speed: 75 cm / 15 cm/h = 5 hours. \n\nOkay, so they meet after 5 hours. Now, to find how far ant A travels in that time, I multiply its speed by the time: 9 cm/h * 5 h = 45 cm. \n\nSo, ant A travels 45 cm until it meets ant B.\n</think>\n\nThe two ants are moving towards each other, so their combined speed is 9 + 6 = 15 cm/h. The time until they meet is 75 / 15 = 5 hours. In that time, ant A travels 9 * 5 = 45 cm.\n\n\\boxed{A}\n\nAnswer: A)45","ground_truth":"A","predicted_answer":"A","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Then, the longer piece would be \\( x + 3 \\) meters because it's 3 meters longer.\n\nSince the total length of the rope is 20 meters, the sum of the two pieces should be 20. So, I can write the equation:\n\n\\( x + (x + 3) = 20 \\)\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n\\( 2x + 3 = 20 \\)\n\nSubtract 3 from both sides:\n\n\\( 2x = 17 \\)\n\nDivide both sides by 2:\n\n\\( x = 8.5 \\)\n\nSo, the shorter piece is 8.5 meters. The longer piece is then \\( 8.5 + 3 = 11.5 \\) meters.\n\nLooking at the options, D)11.5 is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{D}","ground_truth":"D","predicted_answer":"D","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

They could be any numbers that add up to 170, since 2*(length + width) = 340. So, length + width = 170. That means there are infinitely many possible rectangles with the same perimeter. Hmm, that complicates things because I can't just assume the dimensions.\n\nBut the problem mentions a 1-meter boundary around the plot. Does that mean adding 1 meter to each side? If I imagine the plot as a rectangle, and then adding a 1-meter wide strip around it, the new dimensions would be length + 2 and width + 2. Is that right?

The ratio 2:3:5 tells us how much of each ingredient there is relative to each other. So, for every 2 parts of rice, there are 3 parts of wheat and 5 parts of corn.\n\nSince we know there's 3 pounds of rice, I can set up a proportion to find out how much corn is in the bag. Ratios work by comparing quantities, so if 2 parts of rice correspond to 3 pounds, then each part must be a certain number of pounds.\n\nLet me call each part \"x\" pounds.

Maybe I should consider if there's another way to interpret the ratio. Could the ratio be 2:3:5 by weight or by volume? The problem doesn't specify, but since it's a mixture, ratios are typically by weight unless stated otherwise. So, I think my initial approach is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as fractions. The total parts are 2 + 3 + 5 = 10 parts.

The LCM of the intervals will give me the time when all three bells ring together again.\n\nOkay, so I need to find the LCM of 36, 40, and 48. I think to find the LCM, I should break down each number into its prime factors. Let me try that.\n\nStarting with 36: 36 divided by 2 is 18, divided by 2 again is 9, which is 3 squared. So, 36 is 2 squared times 3 squared.\n\nNext, 40: 40 divided by 2 is 20, divided by 2 is 10, divided by 2 is 5, which is prime. So, 40 is 2 cubed times 5.\n\nThen, 48: 48 divided by 2 is 24, divided by 2 is 12, divided by 2 is 6, divided by 2 is 3, which is prime. So, 48 is 2 to the fourth power times 3.\n\nNow, to find the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations. So, for 2, the highest power is 2 to the fourth power from 48. For 3, it's 3 squared from 36. And for 5, it's 5 to the first power from 40.\n\nSo, the LCM is 2 to the fourth power times 3 squared times 5. Let's calculate that.\n\n2 to the fourth power is 16, 3 squared is 9, and 5 is 5.

So, there's an electric pole that's 14 meters high and it casts a shadow that's 10 meters long. Then there's a tree that casts a shadow of 15 meters under similar conditions. I need to find the height of the tree.\n\nHmm, okay, since the conditions are similar, I think this is about similar triangles. The pole and its shadow form a right triangle, and the tree and its shadow also form a right triangle. And because the conditions are similar, these triangles should be proportional.\n\nSo, the pole is 14 meters tall and the shadow is 10 meters. The tree's shadow is 15 meters, and I need to find the height of the tree.\n\nLet's call the tree's height \"h\". Setting up the proportion, the ratio of the pole's height to its shadow should be equal to the ratio of the tree's height to its shadow. That gives us:\n\n14 / 10 = h / 15\n\nNow I can solve for h. Cross-multiplying, I get:\n\n14 * 15 = 10 * h\n\n210 = 10h\n\nDividing both sides by 10:\n\nh = 21\n\nSo the height of the tree is 21 meters. Looking at the options, that's option A.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If the pole is 14 meters and the shadow is 10 meters, the ratio is 14:10, which simplifies to 7:5. If the tree's shadow is 15 meters, then the ratio should be the same. Let's see: 15 meters shadow corresponds to the 7 part of the ratio, so 15 corresponds to 7. To find the equivalent of 5 parts, I can set up a proportion:\n\n7 / 5 = 15 / h\n\nCross-multiplying:\n\n7h = 75\n\nh = 75 / 7 ≈ 10.71, which doesn't make sense because the tree's shadow is longer than the pole's shadow, so the tree should be taller than 14 meters.

The question is about determining how many minutes it will take for y gallons to pass through a drain that's draining at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. \n\nFirst, I need to find the rate at which the drain is removing water. It's given as w/25 gallons every x seconds. To find the rate per second, I divide w/25 by x, which gives me (w)/(25x) gallons per second. \n\nNext, I want to find out how many seconds it takes to drain one gallon. So, I'll take the reciprocal of the rate per second. That means dividing 1 by (w)/(25x), which simplifies to 25x/w seconds per gallon.\n\nNow, since the question asks for the time in minutes, I need to convert the time from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so I'll divide the time per gallon in seconds by 60. This gives me (25x/w) / 60 = (25x)/(60w) minutes per gallon.\n\nFinally, to find the total time for y gallons, I multiply the time per gallon by y.

Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the liquid is draining at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. Hmm, that seems a bit unusual because usually, rates are given as volume per unit time, like gallons per minute or something. So, I need to make sure I understand the units here. The rate is in gallons per x seconds, so I might need to convert that to gallons per minute or gallons per hour if needed.\n\nThe question is asking how many minutes it takes for y gallons to pass through. So, I need to find the time in minutes when y gallons have passed through the drain at that rate.\n\nLet me write down what I know:\n\n- Rate = (w/25) gallons per x seconds.\n- Volume to drain = y gallons.\n- Time needed = ?\n\nI think the first step is to find the time it takes to drain one gallon. Since the rate is w/25 gallons per x seconds, I can set up a proportion to find the time per gallon.\n\nLet me denote the time per gallon as t. So, if (w/25) gallons take x seconds, then 1 gallon would take (x * 25)/w seconds. Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as gallons per second. If the rate is w/25 gallons per x seconds, then gallons per second would be (w/25)/x = w/(25x) gallons per second.\n\nBut since the question asks for minutes, I need to convert gallons per second to gallons per minute. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so gallons per minute would be (w/(25x)) * 60 = (60w)/(25x) = (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute.\n\nNow, I have the rate in gallons per minute. To find the time to drain y gallons, I can use the formula:\n\nTime = Volume / Rate\n\nSo, Time = y / (12w/(5x)) = y * (5x)/(12w) = (5xy)/(12w) minutes.\n\nLet me check the options.

Let me start by understanding the given rate and then work my way through the calculations.\n\nFirst, the liquid is draining at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. That means every x seconds, the drain removes w/25 gallons. I need to find the time it takes for y gallons to pass through. The answer needs to be in minutes, so I'll have to convert the time from seconds to minutes.\n\nLet me think about the rate first. If w/25 gallons are removed in x seconds, then the rate is (w/25) gallons per x seconds. To find out how much time it takes to drain one gallon, I can set up a proportion. If (w/25) gallons take x seconds, then 1 gallon takes (x * 25)/w seconds. That gives me the time per gallon in seconds.\n\nBut the question asks for minutes, so I'll convert seconds to minutes by dividing by 60. So, time per gallon in minutes is ((x * 25)/w) / 60 = (25x)/(60w) minutes.\n\nNow, to find the time it takes to drain y gallons, I multiply the time per gallon by y. So, total time = y * (25x)/(60w) = (25xy)/(60w) minutes.\n\nI can simplify this fraction by dividing numerator and denominator by 5, which gives me (5xy)/(12w) minutes. Looking at the options provided, option C is (5xy)/(12w), which matches my calculation.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the rate of w/25 gallons per x seconds, I converted it to gallons per minute by multiplying by 60, getting (60w)/(25x) = (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute. Then, using the formula Time = Volume / Rate, I plugged in y gallons and (12w)/(5x) gallons per minute, resulting in y / (12w/(5x)) = (5xy)/(12w) minutes. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've got it right. The answer should be (5xy)/(12w), which\n\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step.

The options are A)100, B)160, C)150, D)210, E)220.\n\nAlright, let's break this down. Let's call the unknown number \"x\" for simplicity. The problem mentions fractions and subtraction, so I'll set up an equation based on the words given.\n\nThe phrase \"10 is subtracted from 2/3 of a number\" translates to (2/3)x - 10. On the other side, \"the sum of 40 and 1/3 of the number\" is 40 + (1/3)x. So, according to the problem, these two expressions are equal.\n\nPutting it all together, the equation is:\n\n(2/3)x - 10 = 40 + (1/3)x\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's rearrange the equation to isolate x.\n\nFirst, I'll subtract (1/3)x from both sides to get all the x terms on one side:\n\n(2/3)x - (1/3)x - 10 = 40\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n(1/3)x - 10 = 40\n\nNext, I'll add 10 to both sides to isolate the term with x:\n\n(1/3)x = 50\n\nNow, to solve for x, I'll multiply both sides by 3:\n\nx = 50 * 3 = 150\n\nSo, the number is 150. Let me check the options: Option C is 150. That must be the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{C}","ground_truth":"C","predicted_answer":"C","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

So, I'll subtract 875 from 2272. Let me do that: 2272 minus 875. Let's see, 2272 minus 800 is 1472, and then subtracting 75 more gives me 1397.

According to the problem, these new numbers are in the ratio 12:23. \n\nSo, I can set up the equation: (3x - 9)/(5x - 9) = 12/23. To solve for x, I'll cross-multiply: 23*(3x - 9) = 12*(5x - 9). Expanding both sides gives me 69x - 207 = 60x - 108. Subtracting 60x from both sides gives 9x - 207 = -108. Adding 207 to both sides gives 9x = 99, so x = 11.\n\nNow, the original numbers are 3x = 33 and 5x = 55. The smaller number is 33, so the answer should be B)33.\n</think>\n\nThe smaller number is 33.\n\n\\boxed{B}","ground_truth":"B","predicted_answer":"B","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

Hmm, if Q is p^4, it's not just the product of two primes. For example, if p is 2, Q would be 16, which is 2^4, not 2*2*2*2.

We have Jack who can clean a yacht in 12 hours alone. On a particular day, he finishes two-thirds of the work. So, he did two-thirds of the job and left one-third for Jill to finish. Jill's cleaning rate is 5% of what Jack can do. \n\nFirst, I need to find out how much time Jill takes to finish the remaining one-third of the job. Jack's rate is 1 job per 12 hours, so his rate is 1/12 of the job per hour. Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, which is 0.05 * (1/12) = 0.05/12 jobs per hour. \n\nTo find the time Jill takes to do 1/3 of the job, I can use the formula: time = amount of work / rate. So, time = (1/3) / (0.05/12). Let's compute that:\n\n(1/3) divided by (0.05/12) equals (1/3) * (12/0.05) = 4 / 0.05 = 80 hours.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot of time, but considering Jill's rate is only 5%, it makes sense.

We're dealing with a scenario where each voter has a 90% chance of voting, and we're selecting five voters. We want the probability that exactly four of these five voters actually voted.

The conditions are that the middle letter has to be a vowel, and the first and third letters have to be different consonants. I need to figure out how many different codes can be made under these rules.\n\nOkay, let's start by identifying the different positions in the code. The code is three letters long, so we can label them as Position 1, Position 2, and Position 3.\n\n1. **Position 2 (Middle Letter):** The middle letter must be a vowel.

There are 5 vowels: A, E, I, O, U, and 20 consonants. So, in total, there are 25 distinct letters.\n\nThe code is a 3-letter word, so each position can be filled by any of these letters, but with some constraints.\n\n1. The middle letter must be a vowel. Since there are 5 vowels, the middle position has 5 choices.\n\n2. The first and third letters must be consonants, and they must be different from each other.

That means:\n   - First letter: 20 choices (since there are 20 consonants).\n   - Third letter: After choosing the first letter, there are 19 remaining consonants.\n\n3. All three letters must be different from each other. Since the middle letter is a vowel and the first and third are consonants, this condition is already satisfied because vowels and consonants are distinct.\n\nSo, the total number of codes is calculated as:\n\n20 (first letters) * 19 (third letters) * 5 (middle letters) = 20 * 19 * 5.\n\nLet's compute that:\n20 * 19 = 380\n380 * 5 = 1900\n\nWait, but looking at the options provided, 1900 is option E.

So, the worker takes 9 minutes to drive from home to work at 20 km/h. I need to find out how long it will take to cycle the same route at 6 km/h.\n\nFirst, I should probably find out the distance from home to work. Since speed is distance divided by time, I can rearrange that to find distance: distance = speed × time.\n\nBut wait, the time is given in minutes, and the speed is in kilometers per hour. I need to convert the time to hours to keep the units consistent. \n\nSo, 9 minutes is 9/60 hours, which is 0.15 hours.

But I need to find the time it takes to cycle the same distance but at 6 km/h.\n\nHmm, maybe I should start by finding the distance. Since speed equals distance over time, I can rearrange that to find distance. The formula is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time} \\]\n\nBut wait, the time given is in minutes, and the speed is in km/h. I should convert the time to hours to keep the units consistent.\n\n9 minutes is equal to \\(\\frac{9}{60}\\) hours, which simplifies to 0.15 hours. So, the distance is:\n\n\\[ \\text{Distance} = 20 \\, \\text{km/h} \\times 0.15 \\, \\text{h} = 3 \\, \\text{km} \\]\n\nOkay, so the distance from home to work is 3 kilometers.\n\nNow, if the worker cycles this distance at 6 km/h, I can find the time it takes using the same formula rearranged to solve for time:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{\\text{Distance}}{\\text{Speed}} \\]\n\nPlugging in the values:\n\n\\[ \\text{Time} = \\frac{3 \\, \\text{km}}{6 \\, \\text{km/h}} = 0.5 \\, \\text{hours} \\]\n\nTo convert 0.5 hours into minutes, I multiply by 60:\n\n\\[ 0.5 \\times 60 = 30 \\, \\text{minutes} \\]\n\nSo, it should take 30 minutes to cycle the same distance. Looking back at the options, A is 30. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.
