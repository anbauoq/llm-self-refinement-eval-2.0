That would be 2 chickens * 4 legs per chicken = 8 legs.\n\nNow, to find the total number of legs, I add the legs from the dogs and the legs from the chickens together. So, 8 legs (from dogs) + 8 legs (from chickens) = 16 legs in total.\n\nLet me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 2 dogs at 4 legs each is 8, and 2 chickens at 4 legs each\n\nOkay, so Mrs. Hilt saw 2 dogs and 2 chickens. I need to find out how many animal legs she saw in total. \n\nFirst, I know that dogs have 4 legs each. Since there are 2 dogs, I'll multiply the number of dogs by the number of legs per dog. So, 2 dogs * 4 legs = 8 legs from the dogs.\n\nNext, I'll consider the chickens. Chickens also have 4 legs each. There are 2 chickens, so I'll multiply the number of chickens by the number of legs per chicken. That's 2 chickens * 4 legs = 8 legs from the chickens.\n\nNow, to find the total number of legs, I'll add the legs from the dogs and the legs from the chickens together. So, 8 legs (from dogs) + 8 legs (from chickens) = 16 legs in total.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that right. 2 dogs times 4 legs each is definitely 8, and 2 chickens times 4 legs each is also 8. Adding them together gives 16 legs. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. Each animal has\n\nOkay, so Mrs. Hilt saw 2 dogs and 2 chickens.

So, if there are 2 dogs, that means 2 times 4 legs equals 8 legs from the dogs. \n\nNext, chickens also have 4 legs each. With 2 chickens, that would be 2 times 4 legs, which is 8 legs from the chickens. \n\nTo find the total number of legs, I add the legs from the dogs and the legs from the chickens together. So, 8 legs (from dogs) plus 8 legs (from chickens) equals 16 legs in total. \n\nI think that makes sense because each animal has 4 legs, and there are 2 of each, so multiplying each by 4 gives 8 legs for each type of animal. Adding them together gives the total number of legs Mrs. Hilt saw. \n\nI don't see any mistakes in that reasoning.

There are 5 team members, and the race is 150 meters long. I need to find out how far each runner will have to run. \n\nFirst, I should figure out the total distance and the number of runners. The race is 150 meters, and there are 5 runners. To find out how much each runner runs, I need to divide the total distance by the number of runners.\n\nSo, I'll perform the division: 150 meters divided by 5 runners.

That makes sense because if I multiply 30 meters by 5 runners, I get the total distance of the race, which is 150 meters. \n\nI think that's it.

That seems reasonable because if you divide 150 meters by 5, each person would run the same distance. \n\nI should double-check my math to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 5 times 30 is 150, so yes, that adds up correctly. \n\nI don't think there are any other factors to consider here, like maybe the relay format where sometimes the order or the way the runners pass the bat\n\nOkay, so I need to solve this math problem: There are 5 people on the Green Bay High track team. If a relay race is 150 meters long, and all 5 team members participate, how far will each team member have to run?\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It's about a relay race where 5 team members are running together. The race is 150 meters long, and each person has to run an equal part of it. So, I need to figure out how far each runner will have to run.\n\nHmm, so if there are 5 runners and the race is 150 meters, it seems like each runner should cover a portion of that distance. Since they're running a relay, I assume each runner runs their part one after another. Therefore, the total distance is divided equally among all 5 runners.\n\nLet me think about how to calculate this. If I have a total distance and I need to divide it equally among multiple people, I can use division. So, I need to divide 150 meters by 5 to find out how far each runner will run.\n\nLet me write that out:\n\nAlright, let's tackle this relay race problem.

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each cake needs 3 eggs. That means for each cake, I use 3 eggs. So, if I have 37 eggs, I can make multiple cakes, each using 3 eggs. To find out how many cakes I can make, I should divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per cake.\n\nSo, I take 37 eggs and divide that by 3 eggs per cake. That would be 37 divided by 3. Let me do that division: 37 ÷ 3 equals 12 with a remainder of 1. That means I can make 12 full cakes and have 1 egg left over.\n\nBut wait, the question just asks how many cakes I can make, not how many eggs are left. So, I should probably present the answer as 12 cakes because that's the whole number of cakes I can make without considering the leftover egg.\n\nI don't think I need to consider the remainder here because the question is about the total number of cakes, not the leftover\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many cakes I can make with 37 eggs if each cake requires 3 eggs. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each cake needs 3 eggs. So, if I have 37 eggs, I can start by seeing how many sets of 3 eggs I can make. To do this, I'll divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per cake.\n\nSo, I take 37 eggs and divide that by 3 eggs per cake. That calculation would be 37 ÷ 3. Let me do that division. 3 goes into 37 twelve times because 3 times 12 is 36, which is the closest multiple of 3 less than 37. That leaves me with a remainder of 1, because 37 minus 36 is 1.\n\nNow, since I can't make a partial cake with just 1 egg, I can only make 12 full cakes. The remaining 1 egg isn't enough to make another cake because each cake requires 3 eggs.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is 12 cakes.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{12}","ground_truth":"12","predicted_answer":"12","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

If the company bought 728 gallons, but the tank can only hold 32, then the amount of oil that is not in the tank would be the difference between what they bought and the tank's capacity.\n\nSo, I can write this as an equation: \n\nAmount of oil not in the tank = Total oil bought - Tank capacity\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nAmount of oil not in the tank = 728 gallons - 32 gallons\n\nNow, doing the subtraction:\n\n728 - 32 = 696\n\nSo, the amount of oil that is not in the tank is 696 gallons.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{696}","ground_truth":"24","predicted_answer":"696","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

Let me do that:\n\n39 divided by 7. Okay, 7 goes into 39 how many times? Well, 7 times 5 is 35, and 35 is less than 39. If I try 7 times 6, that's 42, which is too much because 42 is more than 39. So, 7 goes into 39 five times with a remainder.\n\nSo, each group can have 5 balloons, and there will be some balloons left over.

Anna is pouring it into cups, each cup containing 65 milliliters. I need to find out how much tea is left in the pot after she pours as much as possible into the cups.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how many full cups Anna can fill with 65 milliliters each. To do that, I should divide the total amount of tea by the amount per cup.\n\nSo, 1,050 ml divided by 65 ml per cup. Let me calculate that.\n\n1,050 ÷ 65 = 16.07...\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. 65 times 16 is 1,040, which is less than 1,050. So, 65 times 16 is 1,0\n\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, there's a pot with 1,050 ml of tea, and Anna is pouring it into cups that each hold 65 ml. We need to find out how much tea is left in the pot after she pours as much as possible into the cups.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how many full cups Anna can fill with 65 ml each. To do that, I should divide the total amount of tea by the amount per cup. So, 1,050 divided by 65.\n\nLet me calculate that. 65 times 16 is 1,040, which is less than 1,050. So, 65 times 16 is 1,040, and there's 10 ml left over. So, Anna can fill 16 cups completely, each with 65 ml, and there will be 10 ml left in the pot.\n\nSo, the amount of tea left in the pot is 10 ml.\n</think>\n\nThe amount of tea left in the pot is 10 ml. \n\n\\boxed{10}","ground_truth":"10","predicted_answer":"10","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

She wanted to drink 5 bottles each day and initially bought 47 bottles.

Therefore, she'll need to buy an additional 3 bottles on the last day to make up the difference.\n\nSo, Bianca will need to buy 3 more bottles on the last day.","full_output":"Okay, Bianca wants to drink exactly 5 bottles of water each day and has already bought 47 bottles.

To do this, I'll divide the total number of bottles by the number of bottles she wants to drink each day.\n\nSo, 47 bottles divided by 5 bottles per day. Let me calculate that: 47 ÷ 5 equals 9.4. But since she can't buy a fraction of a bottle, I'll need to consider the whole number part. That means she can drink for 9 full days, drinking 5 bottles each day, which is 45 bottles in total.\n\nSubtracting that from the total she bought: 47 bottles - 45 bottles = 2 bottles left.

So, she needs to buy 2 more bottles on the 10th day to reach her goal of 5 bottles each day.\n\nWait, let me make sure I'm calculating this right. 5 bottles per day times 9 days is indeed 45, and 47 minus 45 is 2.

I need to find Steven's age.\n\nFirst, let me understand the relationship between their ages. Devon's age is 2 more than half of Steven's age. So if I let Steven's age be S, then half of Steven's age would be S/2, and adding 2 to that gives me Devon's age, which is 12.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\nS/2 + 2 = 12\n\nTo find Steven's age, I need to solve for S.

So, the formula is Area = Length × Width. \n\nGiven that the area is 20 square feet and the width is 5 feet, I can plug these values into the formula to find the length. So, 20 = Length × 5. To solve for the length, I need to divide both sides of the equation by 5. That gives me Length = 20 ÷ 5, which equals 4. So, the length of the lawn must be 4 feet.\n\nWait, let me make sure I did that right. If the length is 4 feet and the width is 5 feet, then the area should be 4 × 5, which is 20 square feet. That matches the given area, so I think I did it correctly. Yeah, I'm confident with that answer now.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{4}","ground_truth":"4","predicted_answer":"4","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

The question is asking how many books he would have read through after five weeks. \n\nAlright, let me break this down. Each week, Paul reads four books. So, for one week, it's 4 books. If that's the case, then over five weeks, he would read 4 books each week. To find out the total number of books after five weeks, I need to multiply the number of books he reads each week by the number of weeks. \n\nSo, 4 books per week times 5 weeks equals 20 books. \n\nLet me double-check that. If he reads 4 books each week, then after the first week, he has 4 books. After the second week, that's another 4, so 8 books. Third week: 12 books. Fourth week: 16 books. Fifth week: 20 books.

So, if I add the 43 tickets he used to the 55 tickets he had left, that should give me the original number of tickets.\n\nLet me write this down to make it clearer. Let's call the total number of tickets Dave had initially \"T\". According to the problem, after spending 43 tickets, he had 55 left. So, the equation would be:\n\nT - 43 = 55\n\nTo find T, I need to solve for it. I'll add 43 to both sides of the equation:\n\nT - 43 + 43 = 55 + 43\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nT = 98\n\nSo, Dave started with 98 tickets.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{\n\nOkay, let me try to figure out how many tickets Dave had to start with. \n\nFirst, Dave spent 43 tickets on stuffed tiger. After that, he had 55 tickets left. So, if he started with a certain number of tickets, subtracting 43 would leave him with 55. \n\nLet me represent the number of tickets Dave had initially as \\( x \\).

If Dave started with 98 tickets and spent 43, then 98 - 43 is indeed 55. That matches the information given. So, the answer seems correct.\n\nTherefore, Dave had \\boxed{98} tickets to start with.\n</think>","ground_truth":"98","predicted_answer":"98","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

The GCD is the largest number that can divide both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet's list the divisors of each number:\n- Divisors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10\n- Divisors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15\n\nThe common divisors between 10 and 15 are 1 and 5. The greatest of these is 5. Therefore, the teacher can form 5 groups, each consisting of 2 boys and 3 girls. This ensures that all students are evenly distributed without any leftovers.\n</think>\n\nTo determine the greatest number of groups the English teacher can form with the same number of boys and girls in each group,\n\nOkay, so I have this problem where an English teacher wants to divide 10 boys and 15 girls into groups. Each group should have the same combination of boys and girls, and no one should be left out. I need to find the greatest number of groups that can be formed. \n\nHmm, let me think about how to approach this. It seems like a problem involving factors and maybe the greatest common divisor (GCD). The teacher wants to split the boys and girls into equal groups, so the number of groups must be a divisor of both the number of boys and girls. That way, each group will have the same number of boys and girls without any leftovers.\n\nFirst, I'll list the factors of the number of boys, which is 10. The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. Then, I'll list the factors of the number of girls, which is 15. The factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, and 15. \n\nNow, I need to find the common factors between these two lists. The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10, and the factors\n\nOkay, let's try to figure out how to solve this problem step by step. So, we have 10 boys and 15 girls that need to be divided into groups with the same number of boys and girls in each group. We want to find the greatest number of groups that can be formed without leaving anyone out.\n\nFirst, I think we need to find a common factor of both the number of boys and girls. That way, each group can have an equal number of boys and girls. The number of groups will be the greatest such common factor.\n\nSo, the number of boys is 10 and the number of girls is 15. Let me list the factors of both numbers.\n\nFactors of 10: 1, 2, 5, 10.\nFactors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15.\n\nNow, the common factors of 10 and 15 are 1 and 5. Since we're looking for the greatest number of groups, we'll choose the largest common factor, which is 5.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of groups that can be formed is 5.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{5}","ground_truth":"5","predicted_answer":"5","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}
