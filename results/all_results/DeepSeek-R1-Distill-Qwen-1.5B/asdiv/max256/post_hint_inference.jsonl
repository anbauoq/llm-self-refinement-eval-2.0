We need to find out how many animal legs she saw in total.\n\nFirst, I'll consider the number of legs each type of animal has. Dogs have 4 legs each, and chickens also have 4 legs each. \n\nSo, for the dogs: 2 dogs multiplied by 4 legs each equals 8 legs.\n\nFor the chickens: 2 chickens multiplied by 4 legs each also equals 8 legs.\n\nNow, to find the total number of legs, I add the legs from the dogs and the legs from the chickens together. That's 8 legs + 8 legs = 16 legs in total.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check. Each dog has 4 legs, so 2 dogs have 2 * 4 = 8 legs.

I need to find out how many legs she saw in total.\n\nFirst, I know that each dog has 4 legs. So, if there are 2 dogs, the total number of legs from the dogs is 2 multiplied by 4.

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that dogs have 4 legs each. So if there are 2 dogs, I can calculate the total number of legs by multiplying the number of dogs by the number of legs per dog. That would be 2 dogs multiplied by 4 legs per dog, which equals 8 legs from the dogs.\n\nNext, I need to consider the chickens. Chickens also have 4 legs each. Since there are 2 chickens, I'll multiply the number of chickens by the number of legs per chicken. That's 2 chickens multiplied by 4 legs per chicken, which gives me 8 legs from the chickens.\n\nNow, to find the total number of legs, I add the legs from the dogs and the legs from the chickens together. So, 8 legs from the dogs plus 8 legs from the chickens equals 16 legs in total.\n\nWait, did I do that right? Let me double-check.

Hmm, doing this division, 4 goes into 10 two times with a remainder of 2. So, 10 divided by 4 is 2.5. That means each person would get 2.5 cups of lemon tea. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. If each person gets 2.5 cups, then four people would get 2.5 x 4 = 10 cups in total, which matches the total amount she has. So, that makes sense. \n\nSo, each person, including Britney, will have 2.5 cups of lemon tea. That seems fair because they are sharing the lemon tea equally.\n\nOkay, so I've got this math problem here about Britney brewing lemon tea. She has ten cups and wants to share it equally with her parents and three siblings. Let me try to figure out how much each person gets.\n\nFirst, I need to know how many people are sharing the lemon tea. She has parents and three siblings, so that's four people in total. Now, I have to divide the total number of cups by the number of people to find out how much each person gets. \n\nSo, it's 10 cups divided by 4 people. Let me do the division: 10 ÷ 4. Hmm, 4 goes into 10 two times with a remainder of 2. That means each person gets 2 cups, and there's 2 cups left over. \n\nWait, maybe I should think about this differently. If I have 10 cups and I want to split them equally among 4 people, each person should get the same amount. So, 10 divided by 4 equals 2.5. That makes sense because 4 times 2.5 is 10. \n\nSo, each person, including Britney, will get 2.5 cups of lemon tea.\n\nAlright, let me try to figure out how much each person gets when Britney shares her ten cups of lemon tea equally with her parents and three siblings. \n\nFirst, I need to determine how many people are sharing the lemon tea. Britney has parents and three siblings, so that's a total of 4 people. \n\nNext, I'll divide the total number of cups by the number of people to find out how many cups each person gets. So, 10 cups divided by 4 people. \n\nLet me do the division: 10 ÷ 4 equals 2.5. \n\nThat means each person, including Britney, will get 2.5 cups of lemon tea. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. If each person gets 2.5 cups and there are 4 people, then 2.5 multiplied by 4 should equal the total number of cups. \n\n2.5 × 4 equals 10, which matches the total number of cups. \n\nSo, everything adds up correctly. Each person gets 2.5 cups of lemon tea.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{2.5}","ground_truth":"2","predicted_answer":"2.5","is_correct":false,"was_retried":true}

If he bikes instead, it takes him 64 minutes less. I need to figure out how much time he saves by biking instead of walking.\n\nLet me break it down step by step. First, I know the walking time is 98 minutes. The saving by biking is 64 minutes. So, to find out how long it takes him to bike, I subtract the saving from the walking time.\n\nSo, biking time = walking time - saving = 98 minutes - 64 minutes = 34 minutes.\n\nWait, that seems too short. Is biking really only 34 minutes? That would mean biking is significantly faster than walking, which seems a bit fast, but maybe that's just how fast biking is.\n\nNow, the question is asking how much time he saved. So, he saved 64 minutes by biking instead of walking. That","predicted_answer":null,"ground_truth":"34","is_correct":null,"was_retried":true}

Since you can't have half a package, she ate 2 full packages. Each of these packages has 18, so 2 times 18 is 36. She ate 36 crackers in total. She started with 45, so subtracting the 36 she ate, that leaves 9 crackers left. So, Betty has 9 crackers remaining.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Each package is 18, and she ate 45. So, 18 times 2 is 36, which she ate. Then, 45 minus 36 is indeed 9. Yeah, that makes sense. So, she has 9 crackers left.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. It's pretty straightforward once you break it down step by step.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{9}","ground_truth":"9","predicted_answer":"9","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Barbara ate 59 Atomic Fireballs, and each package has 9. To find out how many are left, I need to divide 59 by 9.\n\nFirst, I'll divide 59 by 9. 9 times 6 is 54, which is less than 59, and 9 times 7 is 63, which is too much. So Barbara ate 6 full packages, using 54 fireballs. That leaves 59 minus 54, which is 5 fireballs.\n\nWait, but 5 is less than 9, so she can't have a package left.

{"id":2014,"question":"Denise has 210 crayons and 3 blocks. If she shares the crayons among 30 friends, how many crayons does each friend get?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let's figure out how many crayons each friend gets. Denise has 210 crayons and she wants to share them equally among 30 friends. So, I need to divide 210 by 30 to find out how many crayons each friend gets.\n\nFirst, I'll set up the division: 210 ÷ 30. I can simplify this by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 10, which gives me 21 ÷ 3. I know that 3 goes into 21 exactly 7 times because 3 multiplied by 7 is 21.\n\nSo, each friend will get 7 crayons. That makes sense because if I multiply 30 friends by 7 crayons each, I get 210 crayons in total, which matches the number Denise has.\n\nI think that's it! Each friend gets 7 crayons.","full_output":"Okay, let me try to figure out how many crayons each friend gets. So, Denise has 210 crayons and she wants to share them equally among 30 friends. To find out how many crayons each friend gets, I need to divide the total number of crayons by the number of friends.\n\nFirst, I'll write down the numbers: 210 crayons divided by 30 friends. That would be 210 ÷ 30. \n\nHmm, 30 goes into 210 how many times? Let me think. 30 times 7 is 210 because 30 times 5 is 150, and 30 times 2 is 60, so 150 + 60 is 210. So, 30 times 7 equals 210. That means each friend gets 7 crayons.\n\nI should double-check to make sure I did that right. If each friend gets 7 crayons and there are 30 friends, then 7 times 30 should equal 210. 7 times 30 is indeed 210, so that checks out.\n\nAlright, let me tackle this step by step. So, the question is about Denise sharing her crayons among her friends. She has 210 crayons and 30 friends. I need to find out how many crayons each friend gets.\n\nFirst, I'll visualize the problem. There are 210 crayons, and these need to be equally divided among 30 friends. So, it's a division problem where 210 divided by 30 gives the number of crayons per friend.\n\nI remember that division is about splitting a quantity into equal parts. So, if I have 210 items and I split them into 30 groups, each group will have a certain number of items. That's exactly what I need to find here.\n\nTo make it clearer, I can think of it like sharing candies. If I have 210 candies and I want to give the same number to each of my 30 friends, how many can I give each friend? It's the same idea.\n\nI think about how 30 times 7 is 210 because 30 times 7 equals 210. That means if I give 7 crayons to each of my\n\nOkay, let's figure out how many crayons each friend gets.
