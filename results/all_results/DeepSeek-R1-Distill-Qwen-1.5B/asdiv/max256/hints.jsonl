Let me start by understanding the question and the correct answer. The question is about calculating the cost for two siblings taking Tuition at a music school. The cost is $45 per person, but there's a $15 discount for siblings. \n\nFirst, I should break down the problem step by step. The main issue is applying the discount correctly. If each person pays $45, and siblings get a $15 discount, that means each sibling effectively pays $30. Since there are two siblings, the total cost would be 2 times $30, which is $60. \n\nBut the predicted answer was 60, and the correct answer is <MSK>. That means the student probably didn't apply the discount correctly. The student might have just multiplied 45 by 2, getting 90, and then added the discount, thinking it was a flat fee. But that's not right because the discount is only for siblings, so it's applied to each sibling individually, not to the total.\n\nSo, the hint needs to clarify two main points: first, how the discount is applied per sibling, and second, that the"}

I need to find out how many chairs will be in the sixth row.\n\nFirst, I should identify the pattern. It looks like each row increases by 9 chairs. So, the number of chairs in each row can be represented by a sequence where each term is 9 more than the previous one. That means it's an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 9.\n\nTo find the number of chairs in the sixth row, I can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d, where a_1 is the first term, d is the common difference, and n is the term number.\n\nPlugging in the numbers: a_1 = 14, d = 9, n = 6.\n\nSo, a_6 = 14 + (6-1)*9 = 14 + 45 ="}

The phrase \"thrice the sum of a number and 2\" can be written as 3 times the sum of the number and 2, which is 3(x + 2). \n\nNext, the phrase \"equals 24 added with the same number\" translates to 24 plus the same number, which is 24 + x.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the equation is:\n\\[ 3(x + 2) = 24 + x \\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for x.

Let me break it down step by step. The problem mentions a number, so I'll call that number x. \n\nThe first part is \"thrice the sum of a number and 2.\" That means I take the number, add 2 to it, and then multiply the result by 3.

Looking at the examples, they tend to focus on clarifying each quantity and the operations needed. They also highlight important steps like converting percentages, calculating totals, and considering whole numbers.\n\nIn this problem, the key steps are understanding that each package has 18 crackers, Betty ate 45, and we need to find leftovers. The user's previous reasoning involved calculating packages and total crackers, leading to zero leftovers. But the correct answer is <MSK>, which is 45 - (2*18) = <MSK>. So, the hint should point out that after eating 45, 2 full packages are eaten, leaving <MSK>.\n\nI should avoid mentioning numbers I got wrong or the correct answer, and keep it neutral.

The correct approach is to divide 59 by 9 and see how many packages she ate, then subtract that from the total.\n\nWait, but the question is about left, not how many she ate.
