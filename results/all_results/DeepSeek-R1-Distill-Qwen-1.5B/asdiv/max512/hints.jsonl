Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, Sally had $69.00 before buying the refreshments. After buying the cookies, she had $50.00 left. That means the amount she spent on cookies is the difference between $69.00 and $50.00.\n\nSo, $69.00 minus $50.00 equals $19.00. That means she spent $19.00 on cookies.\n\nNow, she bought refreshments, including juice. The problem is asking how much she spent on juice specifically. But wait, the question doesn't provide information about how much she spent on other things besides juice. It only tells me that she had $50.00 left after buying the refreshments, which includes both the cookies and the juice.\n\nI think I might need to assume that the total refreshment cost is $19.00, but that doesn't seem right because she still has money left. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nLet me try another approach. Let's denote the amount she spent on juice as J. The total refreshment cost would then be $19.00 plus J. But since she has $50.00 left, the total refreshment cost plus $50.00 should equal her original amount, which was $69.00.\n\nSo, $19.00 + J + $50.00 = $69.00. That simplifies to J + $69.00 = $69.00. Hmm, that would mean J = $0.00. That can't be right because she definitely spent money on juice.\n\nI think I need more information. The problem doesn't specify how much she spent on other refreshments besides juice. Maybe she only bought juice and cookies? But then the total refreshment cost would be $19.00 + J = $50.00.

Let me read through the question again to understand what's going on.\n\nThere are 19 children taking a minibus to the zoo. Each seat can have either 2 or 3 children. There are 7 seats in total. I need to find out how many of those seats will have 3 children.\n\nThe reasoning provided starts by noting the total number of seats is 7. Then, it calculates the maximum number of children that could be seated if each seat had 3 children: 7 seats * 3 children per seat = 21 children. Since there are only 19 children, subtracting 19 from 21 gives 2 seats that would be overfilled. Therefore, those 2 seats will have 3 children each.\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many seats will have 3 children. So, the correct answer should be 2 seats because those are the ones that exceed the number of children available. But the user mentioned that the correct answer is actually <MSK> seats. Hmm, that doesn't match my initial reasoning.\n\nLet me double-check. If there are 19 children and 7 seats, each seat can hold either 2 or 3. If I try to maximize the number of children per seat, the first 6 seats can each have 3 children, which would be 6 * 3 = 18 children. That leaves 1 child, which would need to be in the 7th seat. But that would mean the 7th seat has only 1 child, not 3. So, that approach doesn't work.\n\nAlternatively, if I try to have as many 3-child seats as possible, I can fit 6 seats with 3 children each (18 children) and the remaining 1 child would need a 2-child seat. But that would mean only 1 seat has 3 children. But the user says the correct answer is <MSK>, so I must have misapplied something.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider how the children are distributed. Let me think differently. If I have some seats with 2 children and some with 3, I need the total to be 19. Let's set up an equation: 2x + 3y = 19, where x is the number of 2-child seats and y is the number of 3-child seats."}

Let me read through the question again. It says, \"86 students are going hiking. Each school bus can take 9 students. How many students are left?\" \n\nThe reasoning provided breaks it down into steps: calculating the number of buses needed by dividing 86 by 9, which gives about 9.555. Since you can't have a fraction of a bus, they round up to 10 buses. Then, multiplying 10 by 9 gives 90 students transported. Finally, subtracting that from 86 gives a negative number, meaning all students can be transported.\n\nThe predicted incorrect answer was 86, which is just the total number of students, but that's not how it works. The correct answer is <MSK>, which is the number of students left after using all the buses.\n\nSo, the hint needs to clarify that we can't have negative students, which means all students are transported, leaving 0. But since the correct answer is <MSK>, maybe the hint should focus on how to handle the negative result.\n\nWait, the correct answer is <MSK>, so if the students left were negative, that implies 0, but that's not matching. Maybe the hint should point out that since 90 is more than 86, the actual number left is 86 - 90 = -4, but since you can't have negative students, you take the absolute value, which is 4. But the correct answer is <MSK>, so perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the hint should emphasize that the number of students transported is 90, which is more than 86, so the left-over is 86 - 90 = -4, but since that's impossible, the correct answer is 0. But the correct answer is <MSK>, so perhaps the hint should clarify that all students are transported, so 0 left, but since the answer is <MSK>, maybe it's a different approach.\n\nWait, maybe the hint should explain that after transporting 9 buses, only 90 students can be taken, but there are only 86, so all are transported, leaving 0. But the correct answer is <MSK>, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the problem. Maybe the buses can carry 9 students each, but 9 buses would carry 81, and 10 buses would"}

Since we're dealing with kilograms, I'll convert 5 kg 200 g to kilograms. There are 1000 grams in a kilogram, so 200 grams is 0.2 kilograms. Therefore, 5 kg 200 g is 5.2 kg. So, the equation for the first statement is:\n4W = 5.2\n\nTo find W, I'll divide both sides by 4:\nW = 5.2 / 4\nCalculating that gives:\nW = 1.3 kg\n\nSo, one watermelon weighs 1.3 kilograms.\n\nNext, the second statement says: The total weight of 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples is 5 kg 700 g. Again, I'll convert 5 kg 700 g to kilograms. 700 grams is 0.7 kilograms, so 5 kg 700 g is 5.7 kg. Now, the equation is:\n3W + 4P = 5.7\n\nWe already know W is 1.3 kg, so let's substitute that into the equation:\n3 * 1.3 + 4P = 5.7\n\nCalculating 3 * 1.3 gives:\n3.9 + 4P = 5.7\n\nNow, I'll subtract 3.9 from both sides to solve for P:\n4P = 5.7 - 3.9\n4P = 1.8\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\nP = 1.8 / 4\nP = 0.45 kg\n\nSo, one pineapple weighs 0.45 kilograms.\n\nNow, to find how much heavier a watermelon is than a pineapple, I'll subtract the weight of a pineapple from the weight of a watermelon:\nWatermelon - Pineapple = 1.3 kg - 0\n\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. \n\nFirst, we're told that 4 watermelons weigh 5 kg 200 g.

To find the weight of one piece of bread, I divide 500 grams by 5, which gives me 100 grams per piece of bread.\n\nNow, I can find out how much heavier a cake is than a piece of bread by subtracting the weight of the bread from the weight of the cake. That would be 200 grams (cake) minus 100 grams (bread) equals 100 grams.\n\nSo, a cake is 100 grams heavier than a piece of bread.","full_output":"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find out how much heavier a cake is compared to a piece of bread. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that 4 cakes weigh 800 grams. So, to find the weight of one cake, I can divide 800 grams by 4. Let me do that:\n\n800 grams ÷ 4 = 200 grams per cake.\n\nAlright, so each cake weighs 200 grams. Now, the problem also says that the total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1 kg 100 grams. I need to convert 1 kg 100 grams to grams to keep the units consistent. Since 1 kg is 1000 grams, 1 kg 100 grams is:\n\n1000 grams + 100 grams = 1100 grams.\n\nSo, 3 cakes and 5 breads together weigh 1100 grams. I already know that 3 cakes weigh 3 times 200 grams, which is:\n\n3 cakes = 3 × 200 grams = 600 grams.\n\nThat means the 5 pieces of bread together weigh the remaining weight. So, I subtract the weight of the cakes from the total weight:\n\n1100 grams (total) - 600 grams (cakes) = 500 grams (5 breads).\n\nNow, to find the weight of one piece of bread, I divide 500 grams by 5:\n\n500 grams ÷ 5 = 100 grams per bread.\n\nSo, each piece of bread weighs 100 grams. Now, to find out how much heavier a cake is than a piece of bread, I subtract the weight of one bread from the weight of one cake:\n\n200 grams (cake) - 100 grams (bread) = 100 grams.\n\nTherefore, a cake is 100 grams heavier than a piece of bread.\n</think>\n\nThe weight of 4 cakes is 800 g, so each cake weighs:\n\\[ \\frac{800 \\text{ g}}{4} = 200 \\text{ g} \\]\n\nThe total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1100 g. Since 3 cakes weigh 60\n\nOkay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. I need to find out how much heavier a cake is than a piece of bread. \n\nFirst, I know that 4 cakes weigh 800 grams. So, to find the weight of one cake, I can divide the total weight by the number of cakes. That would be 800 grams divided by 4, which equals 200 grams per cake.\n\nNext, the problem states that the total weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread is 1100 grams. I already know that 3 cakes weigh 600 grams (since 3 times 200 grams is 600 grams). So, the remaining weight must be from the 5 pieces of bread. I can subtract the weight of the cakes from the total weight to find the combined weight of the bread.\n\n1100 grams (total weight) minus 600 grams (weight of 3 cakes) equals 500 grams. This means 5 pieces of bread together weigh 500 grams. To find the weight of one piece of bread, I divide 500 grams by 5, which gives me 100 grams per piece of bread.\n\nNow, I can find out how much heavier a cake is than a piece of bread by subtracting the weight of the bread from the weight of the cake. That would be 200 grams (cake) minus 100 grams (bread) equals 100 grams.\n\nSo, a cake is 100 grams heavier than a piece of bread.\n</think>\n\nTo determine how much heavier a cake is than a piece of bread, we start by calculating the weight of each item.\n\n1. **Calculate the weight of one cake:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Weight of 4 cakes} = 800 \\text{ grams} \\\\\n   \\text{Weight of 1 cake} = \\frac{800 \\text{ grams}}{4} = 200 \\text{ grams}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the combined weight of 3 cakes and 5 pieces of bread:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total weight} = 1100 \\text{ grams} \\\\\n   \\text{Weight of 3 cakes} = 3 \\times 200 \\text{ grams} = 600 \\text{ grams","ground_truth":"100","predicted_answer":"5","is_correct":false,"was_retried":true,"hint_sentence":"First, determine the weight of each cake and each piece of bread using the given total weights.

Two stops later, 7 got on and 15 got off.\n\nThe reasoning provided starts with the initial count of 1 person when Jose got on. Then, at each subsequent stop, the number of people changes. The first stop adds <MSK> and subtracts 2, resulting in a net gain of 3. The second stop adds 7 and subtracts 15, leading to a net loss of 8. \n\nSo, the initial count is 1.

That means the user's reasoning might have been incorrect because they didn't consider that people getting off could exceed the current number of passengers, leading to a negative count, which doesn't make sense.

So, the total available is 85 + 25 = 110, and the total rented is 18. So, 110 - 18 = 92. But that's not matching the correct answer of <MSK>. Maybe the initial 85 includes the 18 who came in first, so the total available is 85, and 25 came in later, so total available is 85 + 25 = 110. Then, the ones who came in first were 18, but maybe they already had the skates, so the total available is 85 + 25 = 110, and the ones who came in first used some of them."}

The question is about Ramon putting 26 boxes on the shelf, but there were already 15. Later, he counted 22 boxes. So, the question is asking how many boxes are missing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the quantities involved. There are 26 boxes initially placed, but only 15 were already there. Then, later, 22 boxes were counted. So, the number of boxes missing would be the difference between the initial number and the counted number.\n\nWait, but the initial number was 26, and the counted number was 22. So, if you subtract the counted number from the initial number, you get 26 - 22 = 4 boxes. But that's not the case here because the existing boxes are 15.

Later, he counted 22 boxes. So, how many were missing?\n\nMaybe the correct approach is to calculate how many boxes were not there initially. Since there were 26 initially and 15 were already there, the number of boxes that should have been on the shelf is 26 - 15 = 11 boxes. But later, he found 22 boxes, which is more than the initial 26, so that can't be right. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, no. If he put 26 boxes on the shelf, but 15 were already there, that means there are 26 boxes available. But later, he found 22 boxes, which is less than 26. So, the number of boxes missing would be the initial number minus the counted number, which is 26 - 22 = 4 boxes. But this doesn't account for the existing 15 boxes.\n\nWait, maybe the correct way is to calculate how many boxes were missing from the initial 26.

How many Sweettarts does he have left?\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. Stephen has eaten 64 Sweettarts, and each package contains 7 Sweettarts. The question is asking how many are left. \n\nHmm, so if each package has 7, I can figure out how many full packages he ate by dividing 64 by 7. Let me do that: 64 divided by 7 is 9 with a remainder of 1. That means Stephen ate 9 full packages and 1 extra Sweet tart. \n\nBut the problem is asking how many Sweettarts he has left, not how many packages.

I need to find that number. Let me think through how to approach this.\n\nFirst, let's understand the problem. If I subtract a number from 32, the result is a number where the digits of 32 have swapped. So, 32 becomes 23 after subtracting this number. That means 32 minus this number equals 23.\n\nSo, if I let the number be x, then 32 - x = 23. Solving for x, I subtract 23 from both sides, which gives x = 32 - 23. That simplifies to x = 9.\n\nWait, let me verify that. If I subtract 9 from 32, I get 23, which is indeed the swapped digits. So, the number is 9. But the question is asking for a hint, not the answer. So, I need to explain why 9 is the correct answer.\n\nI should consider the steps that someone might take to solve this problem. Maybe they might think about the digits of 32 being 3 and 2. When subtracting a number, the digits switch places. So, 32 minus x equals 23. Solving that gives x = 9.\n\nAlternatively, someone might try adding 23 to 32, but that would give <MSK>, which is incorrect because adding would not swap the digits. So, that's probably a common mistake.\n\nAnother approach might be to consider the place values. If 32 is 3 tens and 2 ones, subtracting x should result in 2 tens and 3 ones. So, x must be 1 ten, which is 10, but that's not correct because 32 - 10 is 22, not 23. Hmm, maybe that's not the right way.\n\nWait, maybe I should think in terms of place values more carefully. Let's denote the number as x. When subtracted from 32, the result is 23. So, 32 - x = 23. Solving this gives x = 9, which is correct.\n\nSo, the hint should clarify why x = 9 is the correct answer.

But the hint should focus on the reasoning, not the final answer.\n\nI think the key is to emphasize the division step and the meaning of each side's length in the context of the ribbon.

I need to figure out how many notecards I had to complete. \n\nFirst, I know that 12 notecards represent 3/4 of the total. To find the total number of notecards, I can set up an equation where 3/4 of the total equals 12. Let me call the total number of notecards \"T\". So, (3/4) * T = 12.\n\nTo solve for T, I can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3. That gives me T = 12 * (4/3). Calculating that, 12 divided by 3 is 4, and 4 multiplied by 4 is 16.

She has 516 pennies and wants to split them into nine equal stacks. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that to divide equally, I need to see if 516 is perfectly divisible by 9. If it is, then each stack can have the same number of pennies without any leftovers. If not, there will be some extra pennies that need to be distributed.\n\nSo, I'll start by dividing 516 by 9. Let me do this division: 9 into 516. 9 times 50 is 450, and subtracting that from 516 leaves 66. Then, 9 into 66 is 7 times because 9 times 7 is 63, which leaves a remainder of 3.

But wait, that would mean each stack would have 58 pennies, but 9 stacks times 58 is 522, which is more than 516. That can't be right.\n\nI must have made a mistake. Let me try another approach. Instead of dividing 516 by 9, maybe I should consider how many pennies are needed to reach the next multiple of 9. Since 516 divided by 9 is 57 with a remainder of 3, the next multiple of 9 is 57 * 9 = 513, but that's actually less than 516"}

{"id":1740,"question":"Tayli wishes to advertise her business, so she gives packs of 13 red flyers to each restaurant owner and sets of 20 blue flyers to each clothing store owner. At the end of the day, Tayli realizes that she gave out the same number of red and blue flyers. What is the minimum number of flyers of each color she distributed?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem step by step. So, Tayli is distributing flyers to restaurant owners and clothing store owners. She gives 13 red flyers to each restaurant owner and 20 blue flyers to each clothing store owner. The key point is that she gave out the same number of red and blue flyers. I need to find the minimum number of each color she distributed.\n\nHmm, so if she gives out the same number of red and blue flyers, that means the total number of red flyers (13 times the number of restaurant owners) should be equal to the total number of blue flyers (20 times the number of clothing store owners). Let me represent the number of restaurant owners as R and the number of clothing store owners as C.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n13R = 20C\n\nI need to find the smallest positive integers R and C that satisfy this equation. This sounds like a problem where I need to find when 13R equals 20C. Since 13 and 20 are both constants, I might need to look for a common multiple of these numbers.\n\nLet me think about the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 20. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. Since 13 is a prime number and 20 is 2^2 * 5, their LCM should be 13 * 20 = 260.\n\nSo, the smallest number where 13R = 20C is 260. That means:\n13R = 260 => R = 260 / 13 = 20\n20C = 260 => C = 260 / 20 = 13\n\nTherefore, Tayli distributed 260 red flyers to 20 restaurant owners and 260 blue flyers to 13 clothing store owners. This satisfies the condition that the number of red and blue flyers given out is the same.\n\nI should check if there's a smaller number that could work. If I try R = 20 and C = 13, the totals are equal. If I try smaller numbers, like R = 10 and C = 5, then 13*10 = 130 and 20*5 = 100,","full_output":"Okay, so Tayli is distributing flyers to restaurant owners and clothing store owners. She gives each restaurant owner 13 red flyers and each clothing store owner 20 blue flyers. At the end of the day, she gave out the same number of red and blue flyers. I need to find the minimum number of each color she distributed.\n\nLet me define some variables to make this clearer. Let’s say the number of restaurant owners is R and the number of clothing store owners is C. Then, the total number of red flyers given out would be 13R, and the total number of blue flyers given out would be 20C. According to the problem, these two quantities are equal because Tayli gave out the same number of each color.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation:\n13R = 20C\n\nI need to find the smallest whole numbers R and C that satisfy this equation. This sounds like a problem of finding the least common multiple (LCM) or maybe solving for one variable in terms of the other. Let me try to express R in terms of C.\n\nDividing both sides by 13, I get:\nR = (20/13)C\n\nSince R has to be an integer (you can’t have a fraction of a restaurant owner), (20/13)C must also be an integer. That means C has to be a multiple of 13 to make R an integer. Let’s let C = 13k, where k is a positive integer.\n\nSubstituting back into the equation for R:\nR = (20/13)*(13k) = 20k\n\nSo, R = 20k and C = 13k. Now, I need to find the smallest k such that both R and C are positive integers, which they will be for any positive integer k.\n\nTo find the minimum number of each color, I should take the smallest possible k, which is 1.\n\nSo, when k = 1:\nR = 20*1 = 20\nC = 13*1 = 13\n\nTherefore, Tayli distributed 13R = 13*20 = 260 red flyers and 20C = 20*13 = 260 blue flyers.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. If there are 20 restaurant owners, each getting 13 red flyers\n\nAlright, so I've got this problem here about Tayli distributing flyers. She gives red ones to restaurant owners and blue ones to clothing store owners. The number of red and blue flyers she gives out is the same, and I need to find the minimum number of each color she distributed.\n\nFirst, I'll define some variables to make this clearer. Let’s say the number of restaurant owners is R and the number of clothing store owners is C. Then, the total number of red flyers given out would be 13R, and the total number of blue flyers given out would be 20C. Since she gave out the same number of each, I can set up the equation:\n\n13R = 20C\n\nNow, I need to find the smallest whole numbers R and C that satisfy this equation. This is a type of problem where I need to find when two quantities are equal given different rates or quantities per owner.\n\nTo solve this, I can express one variable in terms of the other. Let me solve for R in terms of C:\n\nR = (20/13)C\n\nSince R must be an integer, (20/13)C must also be an integer. That means C has to be a multiple of 13 to make R an integer. Let's let C = 13k, where k is a positive integer.\n\nSubstituting back into the equation for R:\nR = (20/13)*(13k) = 20k\n\nSo, R = 20k and C = 13k. Now, I need to find the smallest k such that both R and C are positive integers. For the smallest k, which is 1:\n\nR = 20*1 = 20\nC = 13*1 = 13\n\nTherefore, Tayli distributed 13R = 13*20 = 260 red flyers and 20C = 20*13 = 260 blue flyers.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense. If there are 20 restaurant owners, each getting 13 red flyers, that's 20*13 = 260 red flyers. For the clothing store owners, if there are 13 store owners, each getting 20 blue flyers, that's 13*20 = 260 blue flyers. So, yes, both totals are equal\n\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem step by step. So, Tayli is distributing flyers to restaurant owners and clothing store owners. She gives 13 red flyers to each restaurant owner and 20 blue flyers to each clothing store owner. The key point is that she gave out the same number of red and blue flyers. I need to find the minimum number of each color she distributed.\n\nHmm, so if she gives out the same number of red and blue flyers, that means the total number of red flyers (13 times the number of restaurant owners) should be equal to the total number of blue flyers (20 times the number of clothing store owners). Let me represent the number of restaurant owners as R and the number of clothing store owners as C.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n13R = 20C\n\nI need to find the smallest positive integers R and C that satisfy this equation. This sounds like a problem where I need to find when 13R equals 20C. Since 13 and 20 are both constants, I might need to look for a common multiple of these numbers.\n\nLet me think about the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 20. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. Since 13 is a prime number and 20 is 2^2 * 5, their LCM should be 13 * 20 = 260.\n\nSo, the smallest number where 13R = 20C is 260. That means:\n13R = 260 => R = 260 / 13 = 20\n20C = 260 => C = 260 / 20 = 13\n\nTherefore, Tayli distributed 260 red flyers to 20 restaurant owners and 260 blue flyers to 13 clothing store owners. This satisfies the condition that the number of red and blue flyers given out is the same.\n\nI should check if there's a smaller number that could work. If I try R = 20 and C = 13, the totals are equal. If I try smaller numbers, like R = 10 and C = 5, then 13*10 = 130 and 20*5 = 100,","ground_truth":"260","predicted_answer":"13","is_correct":false,"was_retried":true,"hint_sentence":"The minimum number of each color distributed is <MSK>, found by setting 13R = 20C and solving for R and C using the least common multiple of 13 and 20."}

Brant has two types of desserts: a chocolate cake cut into 15 pieces and a cheesecake cut into 6 pieces. He wants to prepare identical platters without any leftovers. So, the key here is to find how many identical portions he can make from both desserts.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. He wants identical platters, meaning each platter should have the same number of cake pieces. So, he can't have some platters with more pieces than others. That suggests that the number of pieces per platter should be a common factor of both 15 and 6.\n\nThe next step is to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 15 and 6. The GCD is the largest number that divides both without leaving a remainder.

Initially, there are 8 friends. Then, 3 of them quit. So, the number of friends left playing the game is 8 - 3, which is 5 friends.\n\nEach player who quit had 3 lives.

So, there are 8 friends playing a video game. Then, 3 players quit. Each player who quit had 3 lives. I need to find out the total number of lives the remaining players have.\n\nFirst, let me understand the situation. Initially, there are 8 friends. Then, 3 of them quit. So, the number of friends left playing the game is 8 - 3, which is 5 friends.\n\nEach player who quit had 3 lives. But the problem doesn't specify how many lives the remaining players have. It just mentions that each player who quit had 3 lives. It doesn't say anything about the remaining players. So, I need to assume that the remaining players might also have lives, but the problem doesn't provide information on how many lives they have. \n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The problem says each player who quit had 3 lives, but it doesn't mention the remaining players. So, perhaps the total lives are only from the players who quit. That is, only the 3 players who quit each had 3 lives, so the total lives would be 3 * 3 = 9 lives.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that each player left (including the remaining ones) had 3 lives, then the total lives would be 5 players * 3 lives = 15 lives. But the problem doesn't specify if it's the remaining players or all players.\n\nGiven the wording, it's a bit ambiguous. It says, \"how many lives did they have total?\" It doesn't specify whether it's the remaining players or all. But since 3 players quit, and the remaining 5 are still playing, it's likely that the lives are only from the quit players.
