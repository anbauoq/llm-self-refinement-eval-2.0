Let me do that step by step.\n\n57 plus 60 is 117, and then adding the remaining 6 gives me 123. So, 57 + 66 equals 123.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high, but when you add 57 and 66, it does make sense because 60 plus 60 is 120, and then adding the extra 7 and 6 gives 13, so 120 + 13 is 133. Hmm, that doesn't match my first calculation. Maybe I made a mistake.\n\nLet me try adding it again. 57 + 66. Let's break it down:\n\n57 + 66 = (50 + 60) + (7 + 6) = 110 + 13 = 123.\n\nWait, that's still 123. Maybe I was wrong the second time. Let me verify with a different method. If I add 57 and 66:\n\nStarting from 57, add 60 to get to 117, then add the remaining 6 to get to 123. Yes, that's correct. So, the total number of third graders is 123.\n\nI think I was confused when I thought it was 133 because I misadded. But after breaking it down, it's clear that 57 + 66 equals 123.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{123}","ground_truth":"123","predicted_answer":"123","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

So, we have two groups working together to clean the city. One group has 54 people, and they have 17 more members than the other group. \n\nFirst, let's define the number of people in the other group as \\( x \\). According to the problem, the first group has 17 more members than the second group, which can be written as:\n\\[ 54 = x + 17 \\]\n\nTo find the value of \\( x \\), we'll subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:\n\\[ 54 - 17 = x \\]\n\\[ 37 = x \\]\n\nSo, the other group has 37 members.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n2x + 17 = 54\n\\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), we subtract 17 from both sides:\n\\[\n2x = 54 - 17\n\\]\n\\[\n2x = 37\n\\]\n\nNext, we divide both sides by 2:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{37}{2} = 18.5\n\\]\n\nSince the number of people must be a whole number, we check our calculations.

Assuming the problem is correct, we proceed with the given numbers:\n\\[\n2y + 17 = 54\n\\]\n\\[\n2y = 37\n\\]\n\\[\ny = 18.5\n\\]\n\nSince the number of people must be an integer, we conclude that there might be a mistake in the problem statement or our interpretation. However, proceeding with the given numbers:\n\\[\nTotal\\ number\\ of\\ people = 2y + 17 = 2(18.5) + 17 = 37 + 1\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is: Lizzie's group has 54 people, and they have 17 more members than the other group. How many people are working together to clean the city?\n\nHmm, so first, let's break this down. There are two groups: one with 54 people and another that has 17 fewer members. So if the first group has 54, the second group must have 54 minus 17. Let me calculate that: 54 - 17 is 37. So the other group has 37 people.\n\nNow, to find the total number of people working together, I need to add the members of both groups. That would be 54 plus 37. Let me add those together: 54 + 37 equals 91. So, altogether, there are 91 people working to clean the city.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If the first group is 54 and the second is 37, adding them should give the total. 54 + 37: 50 + 30 is 80, and 4 + 7 is 11, so 80 + 11 is 91. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nIs there any other way to approach this problem? Maybe by defining variables. Let’s say the number of people in the other group is x. Then, Lizzie's group has x + 17. The total number of people is 54, so x + (x + 17) = 54. Combining like terms, that's 2x + 17 = 54. Subtracting 17 from both sides gives 2x = 37. Dividing both sides by 2, x = 18.5. Wait a minute, that's not a whole number. That doesn't make sense because you can't have half a person.\n\nHmm, that suggests that the problem might have a typo or maybe the numbers are such that the other group doesn't have a whole number of members. But the question asks for the total number of people, so maybe we just go with the numbers as given, even if it results in a fractional person count.\n\nSo, 54 + 37 equals 91. That seems straightforward. I think that's the answer they're looking for.\n</think>\n\nThe\n\nAlright, let's try to solve this problem step by step.

Igneous rocks are formed from solid-lified liquid minerals, metamorphic rocks from solid-lified rock fragments, and sedimentary rocks from layers of different materials.

So, there's this region with aquatic reserves, and there are 6 bodies of water in there. Each of these bodies has 175 different kinds of fish. I need to find the total number of fish in the entire reserve. \n\nAlright, so if there are 6 bodies and each has 175 fish, I think I just need to multiply the number of bodies by the number of fish in each. That makes sense because each body contributes 175 fish to the total count. So, 6 multiplied by 175 should give me the total number of fish.\n\nLet me do the multiplication step by step to make sure I'm not making a mistake. \n\nFirst, multiply 175 by 6. Breaking it down, 175 times 6 is the same as (100 + 70 + 5) times 6. \n\n- 100 times 6 is 600.\n- 70 times 6 is 420.\n- 5 times 6 is 30.\n\nNow, add those together: 600 + 420 is 1020, and 1020 + 30 is 1050. So, the total number of fish is 1050.\n\nWait, let me double-check that to be sure. \n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as 175 multiplied by 6. \n\n175 * 6:\n- 100 * 6 = 600\n- 70 * 6 = 420\n- 5 * 6 = 30\nAdding them up: 600 + 420 = 1020, then 1020 + 30 = 1050.\n\nYes, that seems correct. So, the total number of fish in the aquatic reserve is 1050.\n\nI think that's all there is to it. I multiplied the number of bodies by the number of fish in each, and the result is 1050 fish in total.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{1050}","ground_truth":"1050","predicted_answer":"1050","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

{"id":486,"question":"Four girls were home all day one weekend preparing homemade treats. Anna made 33 blueberry cookies.

They need to share these equally among themselves. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, there are four friends in total. Anna made 33 cookies. They want to divide these equally, which means each person gets the same number of cookies. To find out how many each person gets, I should divide the total number of cookies by the number of people.\n\nSo, the total number of cookies is 33, and there are 4 friends. That means I need to calculate 33 divided by 4. Let me write that down: 33 ÷ 4.\n\nNow, doing the division. 4 goes into 33 how many times? Well, 4 times 8 is 32, which is just one less than 33. So, 4 goes into 33 eight times with a remainder of 1. Therefore, 33 ÷ 4 equals 8 with a remainder of 1, which can also be written as 8.25 in decimal form.\n\nBut since we're dealing with cookies, it doesn't make sense to have a fraction of a cookie. So, we need to express this as a whole number. The problem says to share the cookies equally, but it doesn't specify whether they can have a fraction of a cookie or if they need to round down. Given that, I think we should round down to the nearest whole number because you can't have a fraction of a cookie in this context.\n\nTherefore, each friend would get 8 cookies, and there would be 1 cookie left over. But since the problem doesn't mention leftovers, I'll just provide the number of cookies each friend gets, which is 8.\n\nWait, let me double-check my division. 4 times 8 is 32, which leaves a remainder of 1. So, 33 divided by 4 is indeed 8 with a remainder of 1. So, yes, each friend gets 8 cookies.\n\nI think that's it.

{"id":499,"question":"Melody made 26 cut-outs of Christmas trees with red shiny balls. If she planned to paste 4 of this to the front cover of a certain number of cards, how many cut-outs of Christmas trees will Melody have left?","chain_of_thought":"Alright, so Melody made 26 cut-outs of Christmas trees, each with a red shiny ball. She plans to paste 4 of these cut-outs on the front cover of a certain number of cards. I need to figure out how many cut-outs she will have left after she pastes them on the cards.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the problem. Melody has 26 cut-outs in total. She wants to distribute 4 of them on each card. The question is asking how many cut-outs will be left after she has distributed them across the cards.\n\nI think the key here is to determine how many cards she can make with 4 cut-outs each. If she has 26 cut-outs, and she uses 4 on each card, we can divide the total number of cut-outs by the number she uses per card to find out how many cards she can make. The remaining cut-outs will be those that couldn't be placed on a card.\n\nSo, mathematically, this would be 26 divided by 4. Let me do that calculation: 26 ÷ 4 equals 6 with a remainder of 2. That means she can make 6 cards, each with 4 cut-outs, using up 24 cut-outs (6 cards * 4 cut-outs per card). The remaining cut-outs would be 26 - 24, which is 2.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If 4 cut-outs per card, and she has 26, then 4 times 6 is indeed 24, and 26 minus 24 is 2. So, yes, she will have 2 cut-outs left after distributing them on the cards.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes in this reasoning. The division is straightforward, and the remainder gives the leftover cut-outs.

So, the number of pieces not filling up the box is 10.\n\nBut let me double-check my division. 18 times 193: 18 times 190 is 3,420, and 18 times 3 is 54. Adding those together gives 3,474. Subtracting that from 3,484 gives 10. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nSo, the number of pieces of chalk that are not filling up the box is 10.","full_output":"Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, we have a box that can hold 18 pieces of chalk. That means the box can take up to 18 pieces before it's full. Now, we have a total of 3,484 pieces of chalk, and we need to find out how many pieces are not filling up the box, which means they're not at full capacity.\n\nFirst, I think I need to determine how many full boxes we can make with 3,484 pieces of chalk. To do that, I'll divide the total number of pieces by the capacity of the box. So, 3,484 divided by 18.\n\nLet me calculate that. 18 goes into 3,484 how many times? Well, 18 times 100 is 1,800, and 18 times 200 is 3,600. Since 3,600 is more than 3,484, I'll go with 100 boxes. That would account for 1,800 pieces. Subtracting that from 3,484 gives me 3,484 minus 1,800, which is 1,684 pieces remaining.\n\nBut wait, that's not the final answer. I think I need to find out how many pieces are left after filling as many boxes as possible. So, if each box can hold 18, and I have 100 boxes, that accounts for 1,800 pieces. The remaining 1,684 pieces are not filling up the boxes and are therefore not full. \n\nBut I think I might have made a mistake here. Let me double-check. If 18 times 100 is 1,800, then 18 times 100 is 1,800, which is correct. So, 3,484 minus 1,800 is indeed 1,684. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 18 times 100 is 1,800, and 1,800 is much less than 3,484. Maybe I need to adjust my approach.\n\nPerhaps I should use division to find out how many full boxes there are and then find the remainder. So, 3,\n\nOkay, so I have this math problem here: A box can hold 18 pieces of chalk. If there are 3,484 pieces of chalk, how many chalks are there in the box that is not full?\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about figuring out how many pieces of chalk are not filling up a box that can hold 18 pieces each. So, we have a total of 3,484 pieces, and we need to see how many of these don't make the box full.\n\nHmm, okay. So, if the box can hold 18 pieces, then the maximum number of full boxes we can have is the total number of pieces divided by 18. That makes sense. So, 3,484 divided by 18.\n\nLet me do that division. 18 times 100 is 1,800, and 18 times 200 is 3,600. But 3,600 is more than 3,484, so I'll go with 100 boxes. That accounts for 1,800 pieces. Subtracting that from 3,484 gives me 1,684 pieces remaining.\n\nWait, but that's the number of pieces that are not filling up the boxes, right? So, does that mean 1,684 pieces are not full? Or is there something else I need to consider?\n\nHold on, maybe I should think about it differently. If each box can hold 18 pieces, then the number of full boxes is the total number of pieces divided by 18, and the remainder would be the number of pieces that are not full. That sounds right.\n\nSo, 3,484 divided by 18 equals 193 with a remainder. Let me calculate that. 18 times 193 is 3,474. Subtracting that from 3,484 gives me 10. So, the remainder is 10.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. I think I made a mistake in my division. Let me try again. 18 times 193 is actually 18 times 200 minus 18 times 7, which is 3,600 minus 1\n\nOkay, so I have this problem here: A box can hold 18 pieces of chalk. If there are 3,484 pieces of chalk, how many chalks are there in the box that is not full?\n\nAlright, let's try to figure this out. First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about figuring out how many pieces of chalk are not filling up a box that can hold 18 pieces each. So, with 3,484 pieces total, I need to find out how many of these don't fill up the box.\n\nHmm, okay. So, if I divide the total number of pieces by the capacity of the box, I can find out how many full boxes there are and what's left over. That leftover amount would be the number of pieces not filling up the box.\n\nLet me do that division. 3,484 divided by 18. I know that 18 times 100 is 1,800, and 18 times 200 is 3,600. But 3,600 is more than 3,484, so the number of full boxes must be less than 200. Let's try 193. 18 times 193 is 3,474. Subtracting that from 3,484 gives me a remainder of 10. So, there are 10 pieces that are not filling up the box.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. If I have 193 full boxes, each holding 18 pieces, that's 3,474 pieces. Then, the remaining 10 pieces are not filling up the box. So, the number of pieces not filling up the box is 10.\n\nBut let me double-check my division. 18 times 193: 18 times 190 is 3,420, and 18 times 3 is 54. Adding those together gives 3,474. Subtracting that from 3,484 gives 10.

The goal is to make the least number of pieces possible. I need to figure out how many short 1-yard pieces should be cut.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the problem. The worker has a 27-yard rope and wants to cut it into pieces. There are two sizes: 4 yards and 1 yard. The objective is to minimize the total number of pieces. That means using as many longer pieces as possible because each longer piece contributes fewer pieces to the total count.\n\nSo, if I denote the number of 4-yard pieces as x, then the total length of these pieces would be 4x yards. The remaining length of the rope will be 27 - 4x yards, which will be cut into 1-yard pieces. Since each 1-yard piece is 1 yard long, the number of 1-yard pieces will be (27 - 4x).\n\nNow, the total number of pieces is the sum of the 4-yard pieces and the 1-yard pieces. So, that would be x + (27 - 4x) = 27 - 3x.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that. If I have x 4-yard pieces, that's 4x yards, and the remaining length of the rope will be 27 - 4x yards. Each 1-yard piece is 1 yard, so the number of 1-yard pieces is (27 - 4x). So, the total number of pieces is x + (27 - 4x) = 27 - 3x.\n\nHmm, okay, so the total number of pieces is 27 - 3x. To minimize the number of pieces, I need to maximize x because the total number of pieces decreases as x increases. But there's a constraint here.

The goal is to make the least number of pieces possible. I need to figure out how many short 1-yard pieces should be cut.\n\nAlright, let's start by understanding the problem. The worker has a 27-yard rope and wants to cut it into pieces. There are two sizes: 4 yards and 1 yard. The objective is to minimize the total number of pieces. That means using as many longer pieces as possible because each longer piece contributes fewer pieces to the total count.\n\nSo, if I denote the number of 4-yard pieces as x, then the total length of these pieces would be 4x yards. The remaining length of the rope will be 27 - 4x yards, which will be cut into 1-yard pieces. Since each 1-yard piece is 1 yard long, the number of 1-yard pieces will be (27 - 4x).\n\nNow, the total number of pieces is the sum of the 4-yard pieces and the 1-yard pieces. So, that would be x + (27 - 4x) = 27 - 3x.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check that. If I have x 4-yard pieces, that's 4x yards, and the remaining length of the rope will be 27 - 4x yards. Each 1-yard piece is 1 yard, so the number of 1-yard pieces is (27 - 4x). So, the total number of pieces is x + (27 - 4x) = 27 - 3x.\n\nHmm, okay, so the total number of pieces is 27 - 3x. To minimize the number of pieces, I need to maximize x because the total number of pieces decreases as x increases. But there's a constraint here. The remaining length after cutting x 4-yard pieces must be a non-negative integer because we can't have a fraction of a yard in a piece.\n\nSo, 27 - 4x must be greater than or equal to 0.

That leaves 5 people remaining. Now, I can't fill another large room, so I need to use small rooms. 5 divided by 2 is 2.5, which isn't a whole number.

To find the weight of one diamond, we divide the total weight by the number of diamonds: 100 grams / 5 diamonds = 20 grams per diamond. So, each diamond weighs 20 grams.\n\nNext, we're told that the total weight of 4 diamonds and 2 jades is 140 grams.

For the first statement, if 5 diamonds weigh 100 grams, I can find the weight of one diamond by dividing 100 by 5. That would give me the weight of one diamond. Let me calculate that: 100 grams divided by 5 diamonds is 20 grams per diamond. So, each diamond weighs 20 grams.\n\nNext, the second statement tells us that 4 diamonds and 2 jades together weigh 140 grams. Since I already know that each diamond is 20 grams, I can find the total weight of 4 diamonds by multiplying 4 by 20 grams.

So, 5 kg 200 g is 5.2 kg. \n\nNext, we have 3 watermelons and 4 pineapples weighing a total of 5 kg 700 g. Again, converting to kilograms, 5 kg 700 g is 5.7 kg.\n\nNow, let's set up some equations. Let W be the weight of one watermelon and P be the weight of one pineapple.\n\nFrom the first statement:\n4W = 5.2 kg\nSo, W = 5.2 / 4 = 1.3 kg\n\nFrom the second statement:\n3W + 4P = 5.7 kg\nSubstituting W = 1.3 kg:\n3(1.3) + 4P = 5.7\n3.9 + 4P = 5.7\n4P = 5.7 - 3.9\n4P = 1.8\nP = 1.8 / 4 = 0.45 kg\n\nNow, to find how much heavier a watermelon is than a pineapple:\nWatermelon - Pineapple = 1.3 kg - 0.45 kg = 0.85 kg\n\nSo, a watermelon is 0.85 kg heavier than a pineapple.","full_output":"Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. \n\nFirst, I need to find out the weight of one watermelon and one pineapple.

Since we're dealing with kilograms, I'll convert 5 kg 200 g to kilograms. There are 1000 grams in a kilogram, so 200 grams is 0.2 kilograms. Therefore, 5 kg 200 g is 5.2 kg.

She swims every 6 days, runs every 4 days, and cycles every 16 days. I think I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers to determine when all three activities coincide.\n\nFirst, let me understand what LCM means. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers. So, I need to find the smallest number that all three intervals (6, 4, and 16) can divide into without leaving a remainder.\n\nTo find the LCM, I can break down each number into its prime factors:\n\n- 6 can be factored into 2 × 3.\n- 4 can be factored into 2 × 2, which is 2².\n- 16 can be factored into 2 × 2 × 2 × 2, which is 2⁴.\n\nNow, the LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in these factorizations. Here, the primes involved are 2 and 3.\n\nThe highest power of 2 is 2⁴ (from 16), and the highest power of 3 is 3¹ (from 6). So, the LCM should be 2⁴ × 3¹.\n\nCalculating that: 2⁴ is 16, and 3¹ is 3.

So, Anna has a total of 28 coins, which are either nickels or dimes. She has 8 fewer nickels than dimes. Hmm, let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I'll define some variables to make this easier. Let me call the number of dimes \"D\" and the number of nickels \"N\". According to the problem, the total number of coins is 28, so that gives me the equation:\n\nD + N = 28\n\nNext, it says she has 8 fewer nickels than dimes. That means if I subtract 8 from the number of dimes, I'll get the number of nickels. So, the equation for that would be:\n\nN = D - 8\n\nNow I can substitute the second equation into the first one. Since N is equal to D - 8, I can replace N in the first equation with that:\n\nD + (D - 8) = 28\n\nLet me simplify that. Combining like terms:\n\n2D - 8 = 28\n\nNow, I'll solve for D. First, add 8 to both sides:\n\n2D = 36\n\nThen, divide both sides by 2:\n\nD = 18\n\nSo, Anna has 18 dimes. To find the number of nickels, I can plug D back into the equation N = D - 8:\n\nN = 18 - 8 = 10\n\nLet me check if that adds up correctly. 18 dimes and 10 nickels should total 28 coins:\n\n18 + 10 = 28\n\nYes, that checks out. And the number of nickels is indeed 8 fewer than the number of dimes:\n\n18 - 10 = 8\n\nPerfect! So, the final answer is that Anna has 18 dimes.\n</think>\n\nAnna has a total of 28 coins, which are either nickels or dimes. She has 8 fewer nickels than dimes. Let's determine how many dimes she has.\n\nLet \\( D \\) be the number of dimes and \\( N \\) be the number of nickels.\n\nWe know:\n1. \\( D + N = 28 \\) (total number of coins)\n2. \\( N = D - 8 \\) (she has\n\nOkay, so I need to solve this math word problem. Let me read it again carefully to understand what's being asked.\n\nAnna has a total of 28 coins, which are either nickels or dimes. She has 8 fewer nickels than dimes. How many dimes does Anna have?\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, I'll define some variables to represent the unknown quantities. Let's say:\n\n- Let \\( D \\) be the number of dimes.\n- Let \\( N \\) be the number of nickels.\n\nAccording to the problem, Anna has a total of 28 coins. So, the sum of dimes and nickels is 28. That gives us our first equation:\n\n\\[ D + N = 28 \\]\n\nNext, the problem states that Anna has 8 fewer nickels than dimes. This means the number of nickels is equal to the number of dimes minus 8. So, our second equation is:\n\n\\[ N = D - 8 \\]\n\nNow, I can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for \\( D \\). Let's do that.\n\nSubstituting \\( N \\) from the second equation into the first equation:\n\n\\[ D + (D - 8) = 28 \\]\n\nSimplifying this:\n\n\\[ 2D - 8 = 28 \\]\n\nAdding 8 to both sides:\n\n\\[ 2D = 36 \\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[ D = 18 \\]\n\nSo, Anna has 18 dimes.\n\nTo verify, let's check if this makes sense. If there are 18 dimes, then the number of nickels is \\( 18 - 8 = 10 \\). Adding them together: 18 + 10 = 28, which matches the total number of coins given in the problem. So, the calculations seem correct.\n\nTherefore, Anna has 18 dimes.\n</think>\n\nAnna has 18 dimes.\n\nAlright, let's break down this problem step by step. \n\nFirst, Anna has a total of 28 coins, which are either nickels or dimes.

So the answer is correct.\n</think>\n\nMark had 24 marbles and Evan had 3 marbles. After giving some marbles to Evan, Mark has exactly double the number of marbles that Evan has. Let's find out how many marbles Mark gave to Evan.\n\nLet x be the number of marbles Mark gave to Evan.\n\n- Mark's remaining marbles: 24 - x\n- Evan's marbles after receiving: 3 + x\n\nAccording to the problem, Mark's marbles are double Evan's marbles:\n\\[ 24 - x = 2(3 + x) \\]\n\nSolving for x:\n\\[\n24 - x = 6\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, Mark had 24 marbles and Evan had 3 marbles. Mark gave some marbles to Evan, and after that, Mark has exactly double the number of marbles Evan has. We need to find out how many marbles Mark gave to Evan.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables to make it clearer. Let's say x is the number of marbles Mark gave to Evan. \n\n- Mark's remaining marbles after giving some to Evan would be \\(24 - x\\).\n- Evan's marbles after receiving x marbles would be \\(3 + x\\).\n\nAccording to the problem, after the transfer, Mark has double the number of marbles Evan has. So, we can set up the equation:\n\\[\n24 - x = 2(3 + x)\n\\]\n\nNow, let's solve this equation step by step.\n\nFirst, expand the right side of the equation:\n\\[\n24 - x = 6 + 2x\n\\]\n\nNext, let's get all the x terms on one side and the constants on the other side. To do that, we'll add x to both sides:\n\\[\n24 = 6 + 3x\n\\]\n\nNow, subtract 6 from both sides to isolate the term with x:\n\\[\n18 = 3x\n\\]\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 3 to solve for x:\n\\[\nx = 6\n\\]\n\nSo, Mark gave Evan 6 marbles.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure this makes sense.\n\n- Mark had 24 marbles and gave 6 away, so he has \\(24 - 6 = 18\\) marbles left.\n- Evan had 3 marbles and received 6 from Mark, so he has \\(3 + 6 = 9\\) marbles.\n- Is 18 exactly double 9? Yes, because \\(2 \\times 9 = 18\\).\n\nTherefore, the solution is correct.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{6}","ground_truth":"6","predicted_answer":"6","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

The first and second bags together have 11 apples, and the second and third bags together have 18 apples. I need to find out how many apples are in the first and third bags together.\n\nLet me break this down step by step. Let's call the number of apples in the first bag A, the second bag B, and the third bag C. So, we have three bags: A, B, and C, containing A, B, and C apples respectively.\n\nWe know three things:\n1. The total number of apples in all three bags is 24. So, A + B + C = 24.\n2. The first and second bags together have 11 apples: A + B = 11.\n3. The second and third bags together have 18 apples: B + C = 18.\n\nI need to find the total number of apples in the first and third bags together, which would be A + C.\n\nLet me see how I can find A + C. I have two equations involving A, B, and C. Maybe I can subtract some equations to find the individual values.\n\nFirst, from equation 2, A + B = 11. If I subtract this from the total equation, which is A + B + C = 24, I can find C.\n\nSo, (A + B + C) - (A + B) = 24 - 11\nThis simplifies to C = 13.\n\nNow that I know C is 13, I can use equation 3 to find B. Equation 3 is B + C = 18, and since C is 13, B + 13 = 18. Subtracting 13 from both sides gives B = 5.\n\nNow that I have B, which is 5, I can use equation 2 to find A. Equation 2 is A + B = 11, so A + 5 = 11. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives A = 6.\n\nNow I have all the values: A = 6, B = 5, and C = 13. The question asks for the number of apples in the first and third bags together, which is A + C.\n\nSo, A + C = 6 + 13 =\n\nOkay, so I've got this problem here about three paper bags with apples. Let me try to figure it out step by step. \n\nFirst, the problem says there are three bags with a total of 24 apples. Let me call the number of apples in the first bag A, the second bag B, and the third bag C. So, A + B + C = 24. Got that.\n\nThen, it says the first and second bags together have 11 apples. So, A + B = 11. And the second and third bags together have 18 apples, which means B + C = 18. Okay, so I have three equations here: \n\n1. A + B + C = 24\n2. A + B = 11\n3. B + C = 18\n\nI need to find how many apples are in the first and third bags together, which is A + C. Hmm, let me see how to get there.\n\nFrom equation 2, I can express A in terms of B: A = 11 - B. Then, I can plug this into equation 1. So, (11 - B) + B + C = 24. Wait, that simplifies to 11 + C = 24. So, C = 24 - 11 = 13. Okay, so the third bag has 13 apples.\n\nNow that I know C is 13, I can use equation 3 to find B. Equation 3 is B + C = 18, so B + 13 = 18. Subtracting 13 from both sides gives B = 5. Got it, so the second bag has 5 apples.\n\nWith B = 5, I can go back to equation 2 to find A. A + 5 = 11, so A = 6. So, the first bag has 6 apples.\n\nNow, the question is asking for the number of apples in the first and third bags together, which is A + C. So, A is 6 and C is 13, so 6 + 13 = 19. Therefore, the first and third bags together have 19 apples.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nTotal apples: 6 (A) + 5 (B) + 1\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step.

Each of the four boys played 2 games with every other player. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, there are four players, so each one plays against the other three. Since each game is played twice, I need to calculate the total number of games. \n\nLet me start by finding the number of unique pairings.

Each of the four boys played 2 games with every other player. I need to figure out how many games were played altogether. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me understand the setup. There are four players: Alex, Brad, Calvin, and Dennis. Each one plays against every other player, but each game is played twice. So, for example, Alex plays Brad twice, and then Alex plays Calvin twice, and so on.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is to calculate how many unique pairings there are and then multiply by 2 since each pair plays twice. The number of unique pairings can be found using combinations. Since the order doesn't matter in a game (Alex vs. Brad is the same as Brad vs. Alex), I can use the combination formula for choosing 2 out of 4.\n\nThe combination formula is given by C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number we want to choose. Here, n = 4 and k = 2.\n\nSo, C(4, 2) = 4! / (2! * (4 - 2)!) = (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) / (2 * 1 * 2 * 1) = 24 / 4 = 6.\n\nThat means there are 6 unique pairings. Since each pairing plays twice, the total number of games is 6 * 2 = 12.\n\nWait, but let me double-check this because sometimes when counting pairings, I might miss something. Alternatively, I can list all the possible games:\n\n1. Alex vs. Brad\n2. Alex vs. Calvin\n3. Alex vs. Dennis\n4. Brad vs. Calvin\n5. Brad vs. Dennis\n6. Calvin vs. Dennis\n\nThat's 6 pairings, each played twice, so 12 games in total. Yep, that seems right.\n\nAlternatively, I can think of it as each player plays against three others, so each player has 3 * 2 = 6 games.

Let me do the math: 45 minus 18. Hmm, 45 minus 10 is 35, and then minus 8 more would be 27. So, 45 - 18 = 27.\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 18 plus 27 is 45, which means that subtracting 18 from 45 does indeed give me 27. So, it looks like 27 chimps will stay in the old cage after the move.\n\nI think that's it. The answer should be 27 chimps.\n</think>\n\nThe zoo has 45 chimps in the old cage. After moving 18 chimps to a new cage, the number of chimps remaining in the old cage is calculated by subtracting the moved chimps from the total.\n\n\\[\n45 - 18 = 27\n\\]\n\n\\boxed{27}","ground_truth":"27","predicted_answer":"27","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

I need to find out how many more penguins need to get a fish.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many penguins are left without a fish. There are 36 penguins in total and 19 have already received a fish. So, I subtract 19 from 36 to find out how many penguins still need a fish.\n\n36 minus 19 equals 17.

I'll subtract 19 from 68 to find out how many fish are remaining.\n\n68 minus 19 equals 49. So, 49 fish are left.\n\nNext, I'll see how many penguins each fish can serve. Since there are 17 penguins without a fish and 49 fish left, I'll divide the number of fish by the number of penguins.\n\n49 divided by 17 is approximately 2.88. But since we can't have a fraction of a penguin, I'll need to round up to the next whole number, which is 3. This means each of the 17 penguins will need 3 fish to be satisfied.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the total number of fish needed by the remaining penguins. If each of the 17 penguins gets 3 fish, that's 17 times 3, which equals 51 fish.\n\nNow, I'll subtract the number of fish already distributed (19) from the total number of fish (68) to find out how many fish are still needed.\n\n68 minus 19 equals 49. But wait, earlier I calculated that 51 fish are needed for the remaining penguins. This discrepancy suggests that there might be an error in my approach.\n\nLet me re-examine my steps.

Philip wants the same number of pens and pencils, but he can only buy them in specific packages. So, he needs to buy a multiple of both 12 and 15. That means I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 15. The LCM is the smallest number that both 12 and 15 can divide into without leaving a remainder.\n\nTo find the LCM, I can break down both numbers into their prime factors:\n\n- 12 can be factored into 2 × 2 × 3, which is 2² × 3¹.\n- 15 can be factored into 3 × 5, which is 3¹ × 5¹.\n\nTo find the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations. So, for 2, the highest power is 2²; for 3, it's 3¹; and for 5, it's 5¹. Multiplying these together gives:\n\nLCM = 2² × 3¹ × 5¹ = 4 × 3 × 5 = 60.\n\nSo, the smallest number of pens Philip can buy is 60.

So, Philip wants to buy pens and pencils such that the number of pens equals the number of pencils. The pens come in packages of 12, and the pencils come in packages of 15. I need to find the smallest number of pens he can buy so that the number of pens equals the number of pencils.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being asked. Essentially, I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 15 because the LCM will be the smallest number that is a multiple of both 12 and 15. This means I can buy a multiple of 12 pens and a multiple of 15 pencils, and the total number of pens and pencils will be equal.\n\nTo find the LCM, I can use the prime factorization method. Let's break down both numbers into their prime factors:\n\n- 12 can be factored into 2 * 2 * 3, or 2^2 * 3^1.\n- 15 can be factored into 3 * 5, or 3^1 * 5^1.\n\nThe LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations. So, for 2, the highest power is 2^2, for 3 it's 3^1, and for 5 it's 5^1. Multiplying these together gives:\n\nLCM = 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^1 = 4 * 3 * 5 = 60.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of pens Philip can buy is 60, which also means he needs to buy 60 pencils.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I'm doing this right. If he buys 60 pens, that's 5 packages of 12 pens each (since 60 divided by 12 is 5). And for 60 pencils, that's 4 packages of 15 pencils each (since 60 divided by 15 is 4). So, he needs to buy 5 packages of pens and 4 packages of pencils. That seems correct.\n\nBut just to double-check, is there a smaller number that both 12 and 15 can divide into evenly? Let's see:\n\n- 12: 12, 24,\n\nOkay, so I need to solve this math problem: Philip wants to buy pens and pencils so that the number of pens equals the number of pencils.

This way, he has an equal number of pens and pencils.\n\nI think that makes sense. Both 60 is a multiple of both 12 and 15, and it's the smallest such number.

How much does he get from the 1st job if he gets per week a total of $3,875?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how much Mila's father earns from his first job. The problem says he has two jobs, and the first job pays $375 more than the second job. He gets a total of $3,875 per week from both jobs. \n\nHmm, let's break this down. Let me call the amount he earns from the second job \"x\". Since the first job pays $375 more, that would be x + 375. Together, these two amounts add up to $3,875. So, the equation should be:\n\nx + (x + 375) = 3,875\n\nNow, let me simplify this equation. Combining like terms, I get:\n\n2x + 375 = 3,875\n\nNext, I need to solve for x. I'll subtract 375 from both sides:\n\n2x = 3,875 - 375\n\nLet me calculate that. 3,875 minus 375 is 3,500. So now I have:\n\n2x = 3,500\n\nTo find x, I'll divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 3,500 / 2\nx = 1,750\n\nSo, Mila's father earns $1,750 from his second job. Since the first job pays $375 more, the earnings from the first job would be:\n\n1,750 + 375 = 2,125\n\nLet me check if this adds up correctly. If he earns $1,750 from the second job and $2,125 from the first job, the total should be:\n\n1,750 + 2,125 = 3,875\n\nYes, that matches the total he gets per week. So, Mila's father earns $2,125 from his first job.","full_output":"Okay, so Mila's father has two jobs, and the first job pays $375 more than the second one. He makes a total of $3,875 per week from both jobs. I need to find out how much he makes from the first job.\n\nLet me break this down. Let's say the amount Mila's father gets from the second job each week is X dollars. Then, the first job would pay him X + 375 dollars each week because it's $375 more than the second job.\n\nSince he gets both jobs, the total he makes each week is the sum of both jobs. So, that would be X (from the second job) plus (X + 375) from the first job. This total is given as $3,875.\n\nPutting that into an equation: X + (X + 375) = 3,875.\n\nNow, I can solve for X. Let's simplify the left side of the equation:\n\nX + X + 375 = 3,875  \n2X + 375 = 3,875\n\nNext, I'll subtract 375 from both sides to isolate the term with X:\n\n2X = 3,875 - 375  \n2X = 3,500\n\nNow, divide both sides by 2 to find X:\n\nX = 3,500 / 2  \nX = 1,750\n\nSo, Mila's father gets $1,750 from the second job each week. To find out how much he gets from the first job, I add $375 to this amount:\n\nFirst job = X + 375 = 1,750 + 375 = 2,125\n\nTherefore, Mila's father makes $2,125 from the first job each week.\n</think>\n\nStep-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Let X be the weekly earnings from the second job.\n2. The first job earns X + 375 dollars per week.\n3. The total weekly earnings from both jobs are X + (X + 375) = 3,875.\n4. Simplify the equation: 2X + 375 = 3,875.\n5. Subtract 375 from both sides: 2X\n\nOkay, so I have this math problem here: Mila's father has two jobs. The first job pays $375 more than the second job. How much does he get from the first job if he gets a total of $3,875 per week?\n\nHmm, let me try to figure this out. I need to find out how much Mila's father earns from the first job. Let me think about how to set this up.\n\nMaybe I can call the amount he earns from the second job something like X. Then, since the first job pays $375 more, it would be X + 375. So, if I add those two amounts together, they should equal the total he earns per week, which is $3,875.\n\nSo, the equation would be X + (X + 375) = 3,875. Let me write that down:\n\nX + (X + 375) = 3,875\n\nNow, I need to solve for X. First, I'll simplify the left side by combining like terms. X + X is 2X, and then we have +375. So, the equation becomes:\n\n2X + 375 = 3,875\n\nNext, I need to get X by itself. So, I'll subtract 375 from both sides of the equation. That gives me:\n\n2X = 3,875 - 375\n\nLet me calculate 3,875 minus 375. Hmm, 3,875 minus 300 is 3,575, and then minus 75 more is 3,500. So, 2X = 3,500.\n\nNow, to find X, I'll divide both sides by 2:\n\nX = 3,500 / 2\n\n3,500 divided by 2 is 1,750. So, X is $1,750.\n\nBut wait, X is the amount Mila's father earns from the second job. The first job pays $375 more, so the first job's earnings would be X + 375, which is 1,750 + 375 = $2,125.\n\nLet me double-check that. If he earns $1,750 from\n\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how much Mila's father earns from his first job. The problem says he has two jobs, and the first job pays $375 more than the second job. He gets a total of $3,875 per week from both jobs. \n\nHmm, let's break this down. Let me call the amount he earns from the second job \"x\". Since the first job pays $375 more, that would be x + 375. Together, these two amounts add up to $3,875. So, the equation should be:\n\nx + (x + 375) = 3,875\n\nNow, let me simplify this equation. Combining like terms, I get:\n\n2x + 375 = 3,875\n\nNext, I need to solve for x. I'll subtract 375 from both sides:\n\n2x = 3,875 - 375\n\nLet me calculate that. 3,875 minus 375 is 3,500. So now I have:\n\n2x = 3,500\n\nTo find x, I'll divide both sides by 2:\n\nx = 3,500 / 2\nx = 1,750\n\nSo, Mila's father earns $1,750 from his second job. Since the first job pays $375 more, the earnings from the first job would be:\n\n1,750 + 375 = 2,125\n\nLet me check if this adds up correctly. If he earns $1,750 from the second job and $2,125 from the first job, the total should be:\n\n1,750 + 2,125 = 3,875\n\nYes, that matches the total he gets per week.

{"id":1027,"question":"A fence post in Tina's garden is 4 feet tall. When she measured the fence post's shadow, she found that it was 12 feet long. A tree in Tina's yard had a shadow of 72 feet. How tall is the tree?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let me try to figure out how tall the tree is based on the information given. \n\nFirst, there's a fence post that's 4 feet tall, and its shadow is 12 feet long. So, I can calculate the ratio of the post's height to its shadow length. That would be 4 feet divided by 12 feet, which simplifies to 1/3. This means for every foot of height, the shadow is 3 feet long.\n\nNow, there's a tree with a shadow that's 72 feet long. If the ratio is consistent, I can use it to find the height of the tree. So, if the shadow is 72 feet, I can multiply that by the ratio of 1/3 to find the tree's height. \n\n72 feet multiplied by 1/3 equals 24 feet. \n\nSo, the tree must be 24 feet tall.","full_output":"Okay, so I need to figure out the height of the tree in Tina's yard. Let me see. The problem gives me some information about the fence post and its shadow, and then the tree's shadow. I think I can use similar triangles or something to solve this.\n\nFirst, the fence post is 4 feet tall and its shadow is 12 feet long. The tree's shadow is 72 feet long. Since the sun's angle should be the same for both the post and the tree, their heights and shadows should be proportional. That means the ratio of the post's height to its shadow should be the same as the tree's height to its shadow.\n\nSo, I can set up a proportion like this: 4 feet (fence post) over 12 feet (shadow) equals the tree's height (let's call it T) over 72 feet (tree's shadow). Mathematically, that's 4/12 = T/72.\n\nNow, to solve for T, I can cross-multiply. So, 4 times 72 equals 12 times T. That gives me 288 = 12T. To find T, I divide both sides by 12, so T = 288/12, which equals 24.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If the fence post is 4 feet and the shadow is 12 feet, that's a ratio of 1:3. So, the tree's height should also be three times its shadow's length. Since the shadow is 72 feet, three times that is 216 feet. Hmm, that doesn't match what I got earlier.\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake in setting up the ratio. Let me think again. If the fence post is 4 feet tall and the shadow is 12 feet, then the ratio of height to shadow is 4:12, which simplifies to 1:3. So, for every foot of height, there's 3 feet of shadow. Therefore, for the tree with a shadow of 72 feet, its height should be 72 divided by 3, which is 24 feet. Okay, that makes sense now. I think I messed up the proportion setup initially.\n\nSo, the tree is 24 feet tall.\n</think>\n\nThe tree is 24 feet tall.\n\nOkay, let me try to figure out how tall the tree is based on the information given. \n\nFirst, there's a fence post that's 4 feet tall, and its shadow is 12 feet long.

I need to find the original length of the wire before it was cut.\n\nFirst, let me understand the ratio. The ratio 7:5 means that the longer piece is to the shorter piece as 7 is to 5. Since the shorter piece is 40 cm, which corresponds to the 5 part of the ratio, I can use this to find the value of one part.\n\nLet me denote the length of one part as x. So, 5x = 40 cm. Solving for x, I divide both sides by 5: x = 40 / 5 = 8 cm. So each part is 8 cm.\n\nNow, the longer piece is 7 parts, so its length is 7 * x = 7 * 8 = 56 cm.\n\nTo find the original length of the wire, I add the lengths of both pieces: 56 cm + 40 cm = 96 cm.\n\nWait, let me double-check.

This means Andy needs to buy 836 batteries of each type to have the same number.\n\nNow, to find out how many packs he needs for each:\nFor AA batteries: 836 ÷ 38 = 22 packs.\nFor D batteries: 836 ÷ 44 = 19 packs.\n\nTherefore, Andy needs to buy 22 packs of AA batteries and 19 packs of D batteries to have the same number of each type.","full_output":"Alright, so Andy wants to buy the same number of AA and D batteries. The store sells AA batteries in packs of 38 and D batteries in packs of 44. I need to find the smallest number of each battery type he can buy to have an equal number of AA and D.\n\nHmm, this sounds like a problem where I need to find a common multiple of the two pack sizes. The AA batteries come in packs of 38 and D in 44. So, I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 38 and 44 because that will tell me the smallest number of batteries that can be bought equally from both packs.\n\nFirst, I'll factor both numbers into their prime factors. Let's see, 38 can be broken down into 2 × 19, and 44 can be broken down into 4 × 11, which is 2² × 11.\n\nTo find the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization. So, for 2, the highest power is 2² (from 44). For 11, it's 11¹. For 19, it's 19¹. Multiplying these together: 2² × 11 × 19.\n\nCalculating that: 2² is 4, 4 × 11 is 44, and 44 × 19. Let me do 44 × 19. Breaking it down, 44 × 10 is 440, and 44 × 9 is 396. Adding those together, 440 + 396 equals 836.\n\nSo, the least common multiple of 38 and 44 is 836. That means Andy can buy 836 AA batteries and 836 D batteries. To find out how many packs he needs, I'll divide 836 by each pack size.\n\nFor AA batteries: 836 ÷ 38. Let me compute that. 38 × 22 is 836 because 38 × 20 is 760, and 38 × 2 is 76, adding them gives 836. So, he needs 22 packs of AA batteries.\n\nFor D batteries:\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out the smallest number of each battery type Andy can buy so that he has the same number of AA and D batteries. The AA batteries come in packs of 38, and D in packs of 44. \n\nFirst, I think I need to find a common multiple of 38 and 44. That way, I can find a number that both 38 and 44 can divide into, which would tell me how many packs Andy needs to buy. \n\nTo find the least common multiple (LCM), I can use the prime factorization method. Let's break down each number into its prime factors.\n\nFor 38, it's 2 × 19. \nFor 44, it's 2² × 11.\n\nThe LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors involved.

The museum has 15 pictures and wants to split them equally between two exhibits. Since 15 divided by 2 is 7.5, which is not a whole number, we can't split the pictures into two equal whole-numbered exhibits.

So, one exhibit would have 8 pictures, and the other would have 7. But the question is asking how many more pictures they need to make sure each exhibit has the same amount. If one exhibit has 8 and the other has 7, they need to have the same number. So, they need to add one more picture to the exhibit with 7 to make it 8. That way, both exhibits have 8 pictures each.\n\nLet me check that. If they add one more picture to the exhibit with 7, it becomes 8, and the other remains 8. So, both exhibits have the same number of pictures. Therefore, they need to add 1 more picture to the existing 15.\n\nWait, but the original number was 15, and after adding 1, it becomes 16. So, 16 pictures in total, split equally into 2 exhibits, would give 8 in each. That makes sense.

What's the difference between the number of people getting off the bus and still on the bus?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, there's a bus stop where five people got off, and after that, there are ninety people left on the bus. The question is asking for the difference between the number of people who got off and the number still on the bus. Hmm, that sounds a bit confusing. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, let's identify the numbers we have. Five people got off the bus. After they got off, there are ninety people left. So, the total number of people on the bus before anyone got off was more than ninety. Since five people got off, the original number must be ninety plus five, which is ninety-five. So, originally, there were ninety-five people on the bus.\n\nNow, the difference between the number of people who got off and the number still on the bus. Wait, is that asking for the difference between the number who got off and the number who are still on? Or is it the difference between the original number and the current number? Let me read it again: \"What's the difference between the number of people getting off the bus and still on the bus?\" \n\nI think it's asking for the difference between the number of people who got off (which is five) and the number who are still on the bus (which is ninety). So, the difference is fifty-nine. Because ninety minus five is fifty-nine. \n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let me make sure. If originally there were ninety-five, and five got off, leaving ninety, the difference between the number who got off and the number still on is indeed fifty-nine. But another way to think about it is the original number minus the current number, which is also ninety-five minus ninety, which is fifty-nine. So, both ways, it comes to fifty-nine. \n\nI think that's the correct answer because it's asking for the difference between the two numbers given, which are the number of people who got off and the number still on the bus.

So, the original number is \\( 10x + y \\). When we reverse the digits, it becomes \\( 10y + x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, seven times the original number equals four times the reversed number.

So, the original number is \\( 10x + y \\). When we reverse the digits, it becomes \\( 10y + x \\).\n\nAccording to the problem, seven times the original number equals four times the reversed number. So, we can write that as:\n\\[ 7(10x + y) = 4(10y + x) \\]\n\nAlso, the sum of the digits is 3, so:\n\\[ x + y = 3 \\]\n\nLet me expand the first equation:\n\\[ 70x + 7y = 40y + 4x \\]\n\nNow, let's move all terms to one side to simplify:\n\\[ 70x + 7y - 40y - 4x = 0 \\]\n\\[ 66x - 33y = 0 \\]\n\nI can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 33:\n\\[ 2x - y = 0 \\]\n\\[ 2x = y \\]\n\nSo, \\( y = 2x \\). Now, substituting this back into the sum of the digits equation:\n\\[ x + 2x = 3 \\]\n\\[ 3x = 3 \\]\n\\[ x = 1 \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( y = 2 \\times 1 = 2 \\). So, the original number is \\( 10x + y = 10(1) + 2 = 12 \\).\n\nLet me double-check: seven times 12 is 84, and four times 21 (the reversed number) is also 84. Yes, that works out.

Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's represent the two-digit number. I'll call the tens digit 'a' and the units digit 'b'. So, the actual number would be 10a + b. That makes sense because in a two-digit number, the first digit is multiplied by 10 to get its place value.\n\nNow, the problem says the number is four times the sum of its digits. The sum of the digits is a + b, so four times that would be 4(a + b). Therefore, the equation from this part is:\n\n10a + b = 4(a + b)\n\nLet me expand the right-hand side:\n\n10a + b = 4a + 4b\n\nSubtracting 4a and b from both sides gives:\n\n6a = 3b\n\nSimplifying that:\n\n2a = b\n\nSo, the units digit is twice the tens digit.

Let's say the digit in the tens place is 'a' and the digit in the units place is 'b'.

Let's denote the fixed charge as \\( F \\) and the variable charge per kilometer as \\( V \\).

This means that the sum of the tuition fee (T) and the room and board cost (R) is $2,584. So, we can write the first equation as:\n\n\\[ T + R = 2584 \\]\n\nNext, we're told that the tuition fee is $704 more than the room and board cost.

It says that tuition costs $704 more than room and board. I need to find out how much the tuition fee is.\n\nFirst, I think I need to figure out how much the room and board cost alone. Since the total is $2,584 and the tuition is $704 more than that, maybe I can subtract the room and board cost from the total to find the tuition. Wait, but I don't know the room and board cost yet. Maybe I should set up an equation.\n\nLet me call the room and board cost \"R\" and the tuition fee \"T\". According to the problem, T = R + $704. Also, the total cost is T + R = $2,584. So I can substitute T in the second equation with R + $704. That gives me (R + $704) + R = $2,584. Combining like terms, I get 2R + $704 = $2,584.\n\nNow, I need to solve for R. I'll subtract $704 from both sides: 2R = $2,584 - $704. Let me do that subtraction: 2,584 minus 704 is 1,880. So 2R = $1,880.\n\nNext, I divide both sides by 2 to find R: R = $1,880 / 2 = $940. So the room and board cost is $940.\n\nNow, to find the tuition fee, I add $704 to the room and board cost: T = $940 + $704. Let me add those together: 940 + 704 is 1,644. So the tuition fee is $1,644.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If room and board is $940 and tuition is $1,644, adding them together should give the total cost. 940 + 1,644 = 2,584. Yes, that matches the total given in the problem. So my calculations seem correct.\n</think>\n\nThe total cost is $2,\n\nAlright, let's break down the problem step by step to find the tuition fee at State University.\n\nFirst, we know that the total cost for tuition plus room and board is $2,584.

Let me write that down: each side length = perimeter / number of sides. Plugging in the numbers, that would be 60 feet divided by 5. Let me calculate that. 60 divided by 5 is 12. So, each side of the tent is 12 feet long.\n</think>\n\nThe perimeter of the regular pentagon is 60 feet, and since all sides are equal, each side is 60 divided by 5, which is 12 feet.\n\n\\boxed{12}","ground_truth":"12","predicted_answer":"12","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that dividing the total length by the length of each piece will give me the number of pieces. So, I need to calculate 414 divided by 7.\n\nI can start by seeing how many times 7 fits into 414. To make this easier, I'll break it down into smaller parts.\n\nStarting with the first digit, 4, I see that 7 doesn't go into 4. So, I'll look at the first two digits, which are 41. Now, I'll figure out how many times 7 can fit into 41.\n\n7 times 5 is 35, and 7 times 6 is 42. Since 42 is too big, I'll go with 5 times. So, I'll write down 5, multiply 7 by 5 to get 35, and subtract that from 41. This leaves me with 6.\n\nNext, I'll bring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 64. Now, I'll see how many times 7 can fit into 64. 7 times 9 is 63, and 7 times 10 is 70, which is too big. So, I'll use 9 times. I'll write down 9, multiply 7 by 9 to get 63, and subtract that from 64. This leaves me with 1.\n\nFinally, I'll bring down the last digit, which is 4, making it 14. I'll figure out how many times 7 can fit into 14. It goes in exactly 2 times. I'll write down 2, multiply 7 by 2 to get 14, and subtract that from 14. There's no remainder left.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the division gives me 592. That means John's dad can make 592 full pieces of 7 meters each from the 414 meters of string.","full_output":"Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, John's dad bought 414 meters of string, and he wants to cut it into pieces that are each 7 meters long. I need to find out how many full pieces he can make.\n\nFirst, I should understand what it means to cut the string into 7-meter pieces. That means each piece will be 7 meters, so I need to see how many times 7 goes into 414 meters. This is basically a division problem where I divide the total length by the length of each piece.\n\nSo, the total length is 414 meters, and each piece is 7 meters. I can write this as 414 divided by 7. Let me do the division step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll see how many times 7 goes into 41. 7 times 5 is 35, which is less than 41, and 7 times 6 is 42, which is too much. So, 5 times. Subtract 35 from 41, and I get 6.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 64. Now, how many times does 7 go into 64? 7 times 9 is 63, which is less than 64, and 7 times 10 is 70, which is too much. So, 9 times. Subtract 63 from 64, and I get 1.\n\nBring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 14. How many times does 7 go into 14? That's exactly 2 times. Subtract 14 from 14, and I get 0.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the division gives me 592. That means John's dad can make 592 full pieces of 7 meters each from the 414 meters of string.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. 592 times 7 should equal 414. Let me calculate 592 * 7.\n\n7 times 2 is 14, carry over 1.\n7 times 9 is 63 plus 1 is 64, carry over 6.\n7 times 5 is 35 plus 6 is 41.\n\nSo, yes, 592 * 7 is indeed\n\nAlright, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. John's dad bought 414 meters of string and wants to cut it into pieces that are each 7 meters long. I need to find out how many full pieces he can make.\n\nOkay, so this is a division problem where I need to divide the total length of the string by the length of each piece. That means I need to calculate 414 divided by 7.\n\nLet me write this down:\n\n414 ÷ 7\n\nI need to see how many times 7 goes into 414. I'll start by seeing how many times 7 goes into the first digit, which is 4. But 7 is bigger than 4, so it goes 0 times. Then I look at the first two digits, which is 41.\n\nHow many times does 7 go into 41? Let's see:\n\n7 × 5 = 35\n7 × 6 = 42\n\nSince 42 is too big, it goes in 5 times. So, I write down 5, multiply 7 by 5 to get 35, subtract that from 41, and get 6.\n\nNow, bring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 64.\n\nHow many times does 7 go into 64?\n\n7 × 9 = 63\n7 × 10 = 70\n\nSince 63 is less than 64, it goes in 9 times. I write down 9, multiply 7 by 9 to get 63, subtract that from 64, and get 1.\n\nFinally, bring down the last digit, which is 4, making it 14.\n\nHow many times does 7 go into 14? It goes in 2 times exactly.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the division gives me 592. That means John's dad can make 592 full pieces of 7 meters each from the 414 meters of string.\n\nLet me check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. 592 times 7 should equal 414.\n\nCalculating 592 × 7:\n\n7 × 2 = 14, carry over 1\n7 × 9 = 63, plus 1 is 64, carry over 6\n\nAlright, so I need to figure out how many full pieces of 7 meters John's dad can make from 414 meters of string. Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that dividing the total length by the length of each piece will give me the number of pieces. So, I need to calculate 414 divided by 7.\n\nI can start by seeing how many times 7 fits into 414. To make this easier, I'll break it down into smaller parts.\n\nStarting with the first digit, 4, I see that 7 doesn't go into 4. So, I'll look at the first two digits, which are 41. Now, I'll figure out how many times 7 can fit into 41.\n\n7 times 5 is 35, and 7 times 6 is 42. Since 42 is too big, I'll go with 5 times. So, I'll write down 5, multiply 7 by 5 to get 35, and subtract that from 41. This leaves me with 6.\n\nNext, I'll bring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 64. Now, I'll see how many times 7 can fit into 64. 7 times 9 is 63, and 7 times 10 is 70, which is too big. So, I'll use 9 times. I'll write down 9, multiply 7 by 9 to get 63, and subtract that from 64. This leaves me with 1.\n\nFinally, I'll bring down the last digit, which is 4, making it 14. I'll figure out how many times 7 can fit into 14. It goes in exactly 2 times. I'll write down 2, multiply 7 by 2 to get 14, and subtract that from 14. There's no remainder left.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the division gives me 592.

That makes sense because if I know how many boxes fit in each trip, I can calculate how many such groups are needed to reach the total.\n\nSo, the total number of boxes is 871, and the truck can carry 4 boxes per trip. I'll set up the division: 871 divided by 4. Let me do that calculation. \n\n871 ÷ 4 equals 217.75. Hmm, that's not a whole number, which means that 217 trips won't be enough because we can't have a fraction of a trip. Instead, we'll need an extra trip to carry the remaining boxes. \n\nSo, 217 trips would carry 217 times 4 boxes, which is 868 boxes. That leaves us with 871 - 868 = 3 boxes remaining. Since we can't make a fraction of a trip, we'll need one more trip to carry those 3 boxes. \n\nTherefore, the total number of trips required is 218. That seems right because 217 trips only cover 868 boxes, and the last trip will handle the remaining 3 boxes. \n\nI think that's it. So, the answer should be 218 trips.","full_output":"Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.

He bought a total of 379 pieces. I need to figure out how many more pieces he should buy so there are no leftovers.\n\nHmm, let's see. If he has 379 pieces and he wants to split them equally among six friends, I should probably divide 379 by 6 to see how many each friend would get and if there's a remainder.\n\nSo, 379 divided by 6. Let me do the division: 6 goes into 37 nine times (since 6*9=54, which is less than 37? Wait, no, 6*6=36, so maybe 6*60=360. So 379 - 360 is 19. Then, 6 goes into 19 three times (6*3=18), leaving a remainder of 1.\n\nSo, 379 divided by 6 is 63 with a remainder of 1. That means each friend would get 63 pieces, and there would be 1 piece left over. Victor doesn't want any leftovers, so he needs to buy enough pieces to make the total number a multiple of 6.\n\nThe next multiple of 6 after 379 would be 384 because 6*64=384. So, 384 - 379 = 5. That means Victor needs to buy 5 more pieces of candy.\n\nLet me double-check that. If he buys 5 more, he'll have 379 + 5 = 384 pieces. Dividing 384 by 6 gives exactly 64 pieces per friend with no remainder. Yep, that makes sense.\n\nSo, Victor needs to buy 5 more pieces of candy to have an equal distribution without any leftovers.","full_output":"Okay, so Victor wants to give each of his six friends an equal amount of candy. He bought a total of 379 pieces.

That means I need to divide 379 by 6.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 379 divided by 6. 6 goes into 37 nine times (because 6*9=54), but 54 is too big for 37. So I'll try 9 times with a remainder. 37 minus 54 is negative, so I think I made a mistake. Wait, 6*6 is 36, which is less than 37. So 6 goes into 37 six times with a remainder of 1. Then bring down the 9, making it 19. 6 goes into 19 three times (6*3=18), leaving a remainder of 1. So overall, 379 divided by 6 is 63 with a remainder of 1.\n\nThat means each friend gets 63 pieces, and there's 1 piece left over. Victor wants to give each friend an equal amount without any extra.

Victor has 379 pieces of candy and wants to give each of his six friends an equal amount without any leftovers. So, he needs to divide the 379 pieces equally among his six friends.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many candies each friend would get if he divides 379 by 6. Let's do that division: 379 divided by 6. \n\n6 goes into 37 nine times (since 6*9=54), which is too much because 54 is more than 37. So, 6 goes into 37 five times (6*5=30). Subtracting 30 from 37 gives a remainder of 7. Bring down the 9 to make 79. \n\n6 goes into 79 twelve times (6*12=72), which is less than 79. Subtract 72 from 79, and you get a remainder of 7. So, 379 divided by 6 is 63 with a remainder of 1.\n\nThat means if Victor divides the 379 pieces equally among his six friends, each friend would get 63 pieces, and there would be 1 piece left over. Since he doesn't want any extra candies, he needs to have a number of candies that is a multiple of 6.\n\nTo find out how many more candies he needs, I subtract the remainder from 6. Since the remainder is 1, he needs 6 - 1 = 5 more candies to make the total number of candies a multiple of 6.\n\nSo, Victor should buy 5 more pieces of candy to ensure he doesn't have any extra.\n</think>\n\nVictor wants to distribute 379 pieces of candy equally among his six friends without any leftovers.

The formula would be:\n\nNumber of students per grade = Total number of students / Number of grades\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n\nNumber of students per grade = 336 / 7\n\nNow, I need to calculate 336 divided by 7. Let me do this step by step. \n\n7 goes into 33 how many times? Well, 7 times 4 is 28, which is less than 33, and 7 times 5 is 35, which is too much. So, 4 times. Subtract 28 from 33, and we get 5. Bring down the next digit, which is 6, making it 56.\n\n7 goes into 56 exactly 8 times because 7 times 8 is 56. So, that's straightforward. \n\nPutting it all together, 7 goes into 336 exactly 48 times. \n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\nIf I multiply 48 by 7, I should get back to 336. \n\n48 times 7: \n\n40 times 7 is 280, and 8 times 7 is 56. \n\n280 plus 56 is 336. \n\nYes, that checks out.

{"id":1377,"question":"There were 31 groups of people at the bowling alley. If the total number of people was 177, about how many people were in each group?","full_output":"Alright, so I have this math problem here: There were 31 groups of people at the bowling alley. If the total number of people was 177, about how many people were in each group? Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many people were in each group. There are 31 groups in total, and the total number of people is 177. So, I guess I need to divide the total number of people by the number of groups to find out how many people are in each group.\n\nLet me write that down: 177 divided by 31. Hmm, let's do the division. 31 goes into 177 how many times? Well, 31 times 5 is 155, and 177 minus 155 is 22. So, that means each group has 5 people, and there's a remainder of 22. \n\nBut wait, 22 is more than half of 31, so maybe I can't have a fraction of a person. So, I guess I need to round this number. 22 divided by 31 is approximately 0.71. So, each group would have about 5.71 people. But you can't have a fraction of a person, so I guess I need to round this number to the nearest whole number.\n\nIf I round 5.71 to the nearest whole number, it would be 6. But 6 times 31 is 186, which is more than 177. That doesn't seem right because we only have 177 people. So, maybe I should round down to 5.71 and say that each group has about 5.7 people. But that's not practical either. Maybe I should just say that each group has about 5 people, and there are some people left over.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as 31 groups times 5 people per group is 155 people, and then the remaining 22 people can be distributed among the groups. So, each group would have 5 people plus an additional 22 divided by 31, which is about 0.71.

The problem says the paper is 9 inches long and 10 inches wide. So, length = 9 inches and width = 10 inches.\n\nNow, to find the area, I should multiply these two measurements together.

So, the problem is about a book store selling books and bookmarks during Christmas. They sold a total of 72 items, and the ratio of books to bookmarks sold was 9:2.

So, the total number of parts in the ratio is 9 + 2 = 11 parts.\n\nNow, if the total number of items sold is 72, each part must represent a certain number of items.

If the ratio of songs he deleted to songs he kept was 10:3, how many songs did he originally have on his MP3 player?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, Kaleb deleted 20 songs from his MP3 player, and the ratio of deleted songs to kept songs is 10:3. I need to find out how many songs he originally had.\n\nFirst, I know that the ratio of deleted to kept is 10:3. That means for every 10 songs he deleted, he kept 3. So, the total number of songs he had before deletion can be thought of in terms of these parts.\n\nLet me denote the total number of songs he had originally as \\( T \\). The number of deleted songs is 20, and the number of kept songs would then be \\( T - 20 \\).

To find out what one part is, I can divide 18 by 3. That gives me 6. So, each part of the ratio is 6 games.\n\nNow, since he lost 2 parts, I multiply 6 by 2. That gives me 12 games lost. So, Kaleb won 18 games and lost 12 games.\n\nTo find the total number of games played, I add the games he won and the games he lost together. That's 18 + 12, which equals 30 games.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If the ratio is 3:2 and he won 18, which is 3 parts, then each part is 6. So, 2 parts would be 12. Adding 18 and 12 gives 30. Yeah, that seems right.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{30}","ground_truth":"30","predicted_answer":"30","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

That means for every 10 parts of sugar, there's 1 part of flour. The question says I used 50 ounces of sugar, and I need to find out how many ounces of flour I would need.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the ratio 10:1 means. It tells me that sugar is 10 times as much as flour. So if I have 10 parts sugar, there's 1 part flour.

If each cage has 2 snakes and there are 2 cages, then 2 cages times 2 snakes per cage is indeed 4 snakes. That matches the total number of snakes the store has.\n\nHmm, is there another way to think about this? Maybe using multiplication.

Since the question asks for the mean, and the answer is a decimal, I'll round it to one decimal place as requested.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{97.3}","full_output":"Okay, so I need to find the mean number of pizzas sold at John's Pizza Palace over 6 hours. The problem gives me the number of each type of pizza sold: 92 pepperoni, 106 sausage, 96 cheese, 104 mushroom, 96 anchovies, and 88 pineapple.\n\nFirst, I should recall what the mean is. The mean is the average value, which is calculated by adding up all the values and then dividing by the number of values. In this case, I have six different types of pizzas, so I need to add up all the pizzas sold and then divide by 6.\n\nLet me list the numbers again to make sure I have them all: 92, 106, 96, 104, 96, and 88. I'll add them one by one.\n\nStarting with 92 pepperoni pizzas. Adding 106 sausage pizzas gives me 92 + 106 = 198.\n\nNext, adding cheese pizzas: 198 + 96 = 294.\n\nThen, adding mushroom pizzas: 294 + 104 = 400 - wait, no, 294 + 104 is actually 398.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check: 294 + 100 is 394, plus 4 is 398. Okay, that's correct.\n\nAdding anchovies pizzas: 398 + 96 = 494.\n\nFinally, adding pineapple pizzas: 494 + 88. Hmm, 494 + 80 is 574, plus 8 is 582.\n\nSo the total number of pizzas sold is 582.\n\nNow, to find the mean, I divide the total by the number of hours, which is 6.\n\nSo, 582 ÷ 6. Let me do that division.\n\n6 goes into 58 nine times (6*9=54), remainder 4. Bring down the 2, making it 42. 6 goes into 42 seven times. So, 582 ÷ 6 = 97.\n\nTherefore, the mean number of pizzas sold per hour is 97.\n</think>\n\nThe total number of pizzas sold is\n\nAlright, let me try to figure out the mean number of pizzas sold at John's Pizza Palace. Okay, so first, I need to add up all the pizzas sold during the 6 hours. Let me list them out:\n\n- Pepperoni: 92\n- Sausage: 106\n- Cheese: 96\n- Mushroom: 104\n- Anchovies: 96\n- Pineapple: 88\n\nHmm, let me add these up step by step to avoid mistakes. Starting with Pepperoni and Sausage: 92 + 106 equals 198. Then, adding Cheese: 198 + 96 is 294. Next, Mushroom: 294 + 104 is 400. Anchovies: 400 + 96 is 496. Finally, Pineapple: 496 + 88 is 584. So, the total number of pizzas sold is 584.\n\nNow, to find the mean, I need to divide the total number of pizzas by the number of hours, which is 6. So, 584 divided by 6. Let me do that division: 6 goes into 58 four times (4*6=24), remainder 34. Bring down the 4 to make 344. 6 goes into 344 fifty-seven times (57*6=342), remainder 2. So, 584 divided by 6 is approximately 97.333...\n\nBut since we're talking about pizzas sold, it's probably better to leave it as a fraction or a whole number. Let me check: 584 ÷ 6 equals 97 and 2/3. So, the mean number of pizzas sold per hour is 97.333... or 97 and 1/3.\n\nWait, does the question ask for a specific format? It just says to put the final answer in a box and to output exactly two blocks with the final answer. Since I'm supposed to only provide the final numeric answer, I'll stick with the decimal form, which is approximately 97.333.\n\nSo, the mean number of pizzas sold per hour is 97.333.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{97.3\n\nAlright, let me tackle this step by step.

The key point is that she gave out the same number of red and blue flyers. I need to find the minimum number of each color she distributed.\n\nHmm, so if she gives out the same number of red and blue flyers, that means the total number of red flyers (13 times the number of restaurant owners) should be equal to the total number of blue flyers (20 times the number of clothing store owners). Let me represent the number of restaurant owners as R and the number of clothing store owners as C.\n\nSo, the equation would be:\n13R = 20C\n\nI need to find the smallest positive integers R and C that satisfy this equation. This sounds like a problem where I need to find when 13R equals 20C. Since 13 and 20 are both constants, I might need to look for a common multiple of these numbers.\n\nLet me think about the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 20. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. Since 13 is a prime number and 20 is 2^2 * 5, their LCM should be 13 * 20 = 260.\n\nSo, the smallest number where 13R = 20C is 260. That means:\n13R = 260 => R = 260 / 13 = 20\n20C = 260 => C = 260 / 20 = 13\n\nTherefore, Tayli distributed 260 red flyers to 20 restaurant owners and 260 blue flyers to 13 clothing store owners.

Let’s say the number of restaurant owners is R and the number of clothing store owners is C. Then, the total number of red flyers given out would be 13R, and the total number of blue flyers given out would be 20C. According to the problem, these two quantities are equal because Tayli gave out the same number of each color.\n\nSo, I can set up the equation:\n13R = 20C\n\nI need to find the smallest whole numbers R and C that satisfy this equation. This sounds like a problem of finding the least common multiple (LCM) or maybe solving for one variable in terms of the other. Let me try to express R in terms of C.\n\nDividing both sides by 13, I get:\nR = (20/13)C\n\nSince R has to be an integer (you can’t have a fraction of a restaurant owner), (20/13)C must also be an integer. That means C has to be a multiple of 13 to make R an integer. Let’s let C = 13k, where k is a positive integer.\n\nSubstituting back into the equation for R:\nR = (20/13)*(13k) = 20k\n\nSo, R = 20k and C = 13k. Now, I need to find the smallest k such that both R and C are positive integers, which they will be for any positive integer k.\n\nTo find the minimum number of each color, I should take the smallest possible k, which is 1.\n\nSo, when k = 1:\nR = 20*1 = 20\nC = 13*1 = 13\n\nTherefore, Tayli distributed 13R = 13*20 = 260 red flyers and 20C = 20*13 = 260 blue flyers.\n\nLet me check if this makes sense.

The key here is to find the least common multiple (LCM) of their lap times because the LCM will give me the smallest time when both have completed whole numbers of laps, bringing them back to the starting point together.\n\nFirst, I need to find the LCM of 12 and 18. To do this, I can factor both numbers into their prime factors.\n\n12 can be factored into 2 * 2 * 3, or \\(2^2 \\times 3\\).\n\n18 can be factored into 2 * 3 * 3, or \\(2 \\times 3^2\\).\n\nThe LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations. So for 2, the highest power is \\(2^2\\), and for 3, it's \\(3^2\\).\n\nMultiplying these together: \\(2^2 \\times 3^2 = 4 \\times 9 = 36\\).\n\nSo, the LCM of 12 and 18 is 36. That means after 36 minutes, both bikers will have completed whole numbers of laps and will meet again at the starting point.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure. In 36 minutes, the first biker completes \\(36 / 12 = 3\\) laps. The second biker completes \\(36 / 18 = 2\\) laps. Yep, both are back at the start after 36 minutes.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 36 minutes.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{36}","ground_truth":"36","predicted_answer":"36","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Additionally, every 30th caller gets free concert tickets. So, I need to find the smallest number of callers where one person receives both a coupon and a concert ticket.\n\nThis sounds like a problem where I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 100 and 30 because the LCM will be the first number that is a multiple of both 100 and 30.

One way is to break down both numbers into their prime factors.\n\nStarting with 100:\n100 can be factored into 2 * 50, and 50 is 2 * 25, and 25 is 5 * 5.

So, for 2, the highest power is 2^2; for 3, it's 3^1; and for 5, it's 5^2.\n\nMultiplying these together: 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^2 = 4 * 3 * 25 = 12 * 25 = 300.\n\nTherefore, the LCM of 100 and 30 is 300.

All yellow paint comes in 2-liter containers while blue paint is sold in containers of 19 liter.

Yellow paint is sold in 2-liter containers.\n3. Blue paint is sold in 19-liter containers.\n4. I need to find the smallest number of each paint color sold.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what \"equal quantities\" means here. It probably means the total volume of yellow paint sold equals the total volume of blue paint sold. So, if they sold Y containers of yellow, that's 2Y liters. Similarly, if they sold B containers of blue, that's 19B liters. So, 2Y = 19B.\n\nNow, I need to find the smallest Y and B such that 2Y equals 19B. This seems like a problem where I need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 19 because the smallest number that both 2 and 19 can divide into would be the LCM.\n\nThe LCM of 2 and 19 is 38 because 2 and 19 are both prime numbers. So, the smallest multiple they can both reach is 38. Therefore, 2Y = 38 implies Y = 19 containers, and 19B = 38 implies B = 2 containers.\n\nSo, the store needs to have sold 19 containers of yellow paint (2 liters each) and 2 containers of blue paint (19 liters each) to have equal quantities.

Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, let's understand what it means to sell equal quantities of each paint. It doesn't specify how many liters, just that the amounts sold are equal. So, the total volume of yellow paint sold must be equal to the total volume of blue paint sold.\n\nYellow paint is 2-liter containers, so if they sold, say, 1 container, that's 2 liters. Blue paint is 19-liter containers, so one container would be 19 liters. But since the quantities sold are equal, I need to find a number of containers for yellow and blue such that their total volumes are the same.\n\nLet me denote the number of containers sold for yellow as Y and for blue as B. Since the quantities sold are equal, the total liters for yellow would be 2Y and for blue would be 19B. We need 2Y = 19B.\n\nSo, 2Y = 19B. I need to find the smallest integers Y and B that satisfy this equation. This looks like a problem of finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 2 and 19 because the LCM will be the smallest number that both 2 and 19 can divide into.\n\nThe prime factors of 2 are just 2, and for 19, it's 19. Since they are both prime and different, the LCM is 2 * 19 = 38.\n\nSo, the smallest Y would be 19 and the smallest B would be 2 because 2 * 19 = 19 * 2 = 38 liters. Therefore, they need to have sold 19 containers of yellow paint (2 liters each) and 2 containers of blue paint (19 liters each) to have equal quantities.\n\nWait, let me check that. 19 containers of yellow paint would be 19 * 2 = 38 liters. 2 containers of blue paint would be 2 * 19 = 38 liters.

What is the greatest number of groups that can be formed?","chain_of_thought":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The question is about dividing 10 boys and 15 girls into groups with the same number of boys and girls, ensuring no one is left out. We need to find the greatest number of groups possible.\n\nFirst, I recognize that this is a problem related to factors. The number of groups must be a common factor of both the number of boys (10) and the number of girls (15). The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 15 will give us the largest number of groups that can be formed without leaving anyone out.\n\nTo find the GCD, I'll use the prime factorization method. \n\n- The prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5 (since 10 = 2 × 5).\n- The prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5 (since 15 = 3 × 5).\n\nThe common prime factor between 10 and 15 is 5. Therefore, the GCD is 5.\n\nThis means the teacher can form 5 groups, with each group containing 2 boys (10 ÷ 5) and 3 girls (15 ÷ 5). There will be no leftovers, as both numbers are perfectly divisible by 5.\n\nI should also consider if there's a possibility of forming more groups by using a different factor. Since the GCD is 5, any number larger than 5 would not divide evenly into both 10 and 15. For example, trying to form 10 groups would require 1 boy per group (10 ÷ 10 = 1) and 1.5 girls per group (15 ÷ 10 = 1.5), which isn't possible because you can't have half a girl in a group. Similarly, trying to form 15 groups would result in 2/3 of a boy per group (10 ÷ 15 = 2/3) and 1 girl per group (15 ÷ 15 = 1), which also isn't possible.\n\nTherefore, 5 is indeed the greatest number of groups that can be formed without any leftovers.","full_output":"Okay, so I have this problem where an English teacher wants to divide 10 boys and 15 girls into groups with the same number of boys and girls in each group, and no one should be left out.

So, the number of groups must be a common factor of both the number of boys and the number of girls. That means I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 10 and 15 because the GCD will tell me the largest number of groups possible without leaving anyone out.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD. One method is the prime factorization method. I'll factor both 10 and 15 into their prime factors.\n\nStarting with 10:\n10 can be factored into 2 and 5, so 10 = 2 × 5.\n\nNow for 15:\n15 can be factored into 3 and 5, so 15 = 3 × 5.\n\nLooking at both factorizations, I see that both numbers have a common factor of 5. There are no other common factors since 10 has 2 and 5, and 15 has 3 and 5. So, the greatest common divisor is 5.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of groups the teacher can form is 5. Each group will have 10 ÷ 5 = 2 boys and 15 ÷ 5 = 3 girls. That way, all the boys and girls are evenly distributed without any leftovers.\n\nI should double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If I try dividing 10 by a higher number, like 10 itself, that would leave no girls, which isn't allowed. Similarly, 15 divided by 15 would leave no boys. So, 5 is indeed the largest number that works for both boys and girls.\n\nAnother way to confirm is by listing the factors of each number and finding the largest common one. Factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, 10, and factors of 15 are 1, 3, 5, 15. The common factors are 1 and 5, with\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step.

So, if I can find the LCM of 75 and 90, that should give me the minimum distance they need to walk.\n\nTo find the LCM, I think I can use the formula: LCM(a, b) = (a × b) / GCD(a, b), where GCD is the greatest common divisor. So, first, I need to find the GCD of 75 and 90.\n\nLet me list the factors of each number to find the GCD. The factors of 75 are 1, 3, 5, 15, 25, and 75. The factors of 90 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, and 90. The common factors are 1, 3, 5, and 15. The greatest one is 15, so GCD(75, 90) = 15.\n\nNow, plugging the values into the LCM formula: LCM(75, 90) = (75 × 90) / 15. Let's calculate that. 75 multiplied by 90 is 6750. Divided by 15 gives 6750 / 15 = 450. So, the LCM is 450.\n\nTherefore, the minimum distance each should walk is 450 cm, which is 4.5 meters. This means both persons will take 6 steps (75 cm each) and 5 steps (90 cm each) respectively to cover 450 cm.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{450}","ground_truth":"450","predicted_answer":"450","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Since I have 30 chunks of cantaloupe and 42 chunks of honeydew, the limiting factor would be the number of chunks of cantaloupe because there are fewer of them.\n\nTherefore, I can make 30 servings, each using one chunk of cantaloupe and one chunk of honeydew. That way, I'll use up all 30 chunks of cantaloupe and 30 out of the 42 chunks of honeydew, leaving some honeydew unused.\n\nWait, but what if each serving doesn't necessarily require one chunk of each fruit? The problem doesn't specify, so I have to make an assumption. Without more information, it's reasonable to assume that each serving uses one chunk of each type of fruit. This is a common assumption in such problems unless specified otherwise.\n\nSo, sticking with that, the maximum number of servings I can make is 30, using all the cantaloupe chunks and half of the honeydew chunks.\n\nI think that's the answer.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{30}","ground_truth":"6","predicted_answer":"30","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

Then, they receive eleven more shirts. So I need to add those eleven shirts to the original fifty-six.\n\nHmm, adding fifty-six and eleven. Let me write that down to visualize it better. So, 56 plus 11. I can think of it as 56 plus 10 plus 1, which is 66. Wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me check again. 56 plus 10 is 66, and then adding the extra 1 makes it 67. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, I can use another method to confirm. If I count up from 56 by eleven, I can add one by one: 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67. That also gets me to 67. So both methods confirm that the total number of shirts is 67.\n\nWait, but just to be sure, is there another way to approach this?

So, fifty-six plus ten is sixty-six, and then adding one more is sixty-seven. Yep, that checks out too.\n\nI don't think I've missed anything here. The problem is pretty straightforward: adding fifty-six and eleven to get the total number of shirts.

Let me note down the numbers: 2 shirts and 33 sweaters. So in total, that's 2 + 33 = 35 pieces of clothing.\n\nNow, each load can handle seven pieces. So I need to divide the total number of clothes by the capacity of the washing machine. That would be 35 divided by 7. Let me calculate that: 35 ÷ 7 = 5.\n\nWait, does that mean she can do 5 loads? That seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Each load can take seven clothes, so if she does five loads, that should be 5 × 7 = 35 clothes, which matches the total she has. So yes, 5 loads should be enough.\n\nI don't think there's any trick here, like considering if she needs to wash more loads or if there are any restrictions on the number of clothes per load. The question says she has two shirts and thirty-three sweaters, so all the clothes are accounted for in the total of 35. Therefore, dividing by 7 gives the correct number of loads needed.\n\nSo, after considering all the steps, I'm confident that the answer is 5 loads.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{5}","ground_truth":"5","predicted_answer":"5","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Okay, so Amy has 54 seeds left for her small gardens.\n\nNow, she puts six seeds in each small garden. I need to find out how many small gardens she can make with 54 seeds. To do this, I'll divide the remaining seeds by the number of seeds per small garden.\n\n54 divided by 6 is... 54 / 6 equals 9. So, Amy has 9 small gardens.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If she has 54 seeds and each small garden has 6 seeds, dividing 54 by 6 should give the number of gardens. Yeah, 6 times 9 is 54, so that checks out.\n\nSo, Amy has 9 small gardens.\n</think>\n\nThe final answer is 9 small gardens, so the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{9}","ground_truth":"9","predicted_answer":"9","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

It seems like we're supposed to divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups to find out the size of each group. That makes sense because dividing the bananas into equal groups means each group will have the same number of bananas.\n\nSo, the total number of bananas is 3300, and we're dividing them into 75 groups. To find out how many bananas are in each group, I should perform the division: 3300 divided by 75.\n\nI can write this as a mathematical expression:\n\nNumber of bananas per group = Total bananas / Number of groups\nNumber of bananas per group = 3300 / 75\n\nNow, I need to calculate this division.

Each student already has 9 Skittles, but we're focusing on the apples now.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many apples each student gets from the 1720 apples. To do this, I'll divide 1720 by 43. Let me calculate that:\n\n1720 ÷ 43\n\nHmm, 43 times 30 is 1290. That's too low. Let's try 43 times 40, which is 1720. Oh, wait, 43 times 40 is exactly 1720. So, 1720 divided by 43 is 40. That means each student gets 40 apples.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider the apples the students already have. Each student has 9 Skittles, so the total number of apples they already have is 43 times 9, which is 387 apples. \n\nNow, if there are 1720 apples in total and 387 of them are already given to the students, the number of apples left to distribute is 1720 - 387 = 1333 apples.\n\nNow, we have 1333 apples to distribute equally among 43 students.

So, we have 43 students and 1720 apples. Each student already has 9 Skittles.

Since there are 43 students and each gets 9 Skittles, we can calculate the total number of apples the students already have by multiplying the number of students by the number of apples each gets. That would be 43 multiplied by 9.\n\nLet me do that multiplication: 43 * 9. Hmm, 40*9 is 360, and 3*9 is 27, so adding those together gives 360 + 27 = 387 apples. So, the students already have 387 apples.\n\nNow, the total number of apples available is 1720. If we subtract the 387 apples the students already have, we'll find out how many apples are left to distribute equally among the students.

So, there are 1333 apples left to distribute.\n\nNow, we need to divide these 1333 apples equally among the 43 students. To find out how many apples each student gets, we divide 1333 by 43. Let me do that division.\n\nFirst, I'll see how many times 43 goes into 133. 43*3 is 129, which is less than 133. Subtracting 129 from 133 gives a remainder of 4. Then, bring down the next digit, which is 3, making it 43. 43 goes into 43 exactly once. So, we have 3 with a remainder of 4, and then 1 more. So, the division gives us 31 with a remainder of 12.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. Let me double-check the division.\n\nAlright, let's tackle this step by step. We have 43 students and 1720 apples. Each student already has 9 Skittles, but we're focusing on the apples now.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many apples each student gets from the 1720 apples. To do this, I'll divide 1720 by 43. Let me calculate that:\n\n1720 ÷ 43\n\nHmm, 43 times 30 is 1290. That's too low. Let's try 43 times 40, which is 1720. Oh, wait, 43 times 40 is exactly 1720. So, 1720 divided by 43 is 40. That means each student gets 40 apples.\n\nBut wait, I should also consider the apples the students already have. Each student has 9 Skittles, so the total number of apples they already have is 43 times 9, which is 387 apples. \n\nNow, if there are 1720 apples in total and 387 of them are already given to the students, the number of apples left to distribute is 1720 - 387 = 1333 apples.\n\nNow, we have 1333 apples to distribute equally among 43 students. So, we'll divide 1333 by 43.\n\n1333 ÷ 43\n\nLet me calculate that. 43 times 30 is 1290. Subtracting that from 1333 gives us 43. So, 43 goes into 1333 exactly 31 times with no remainder.\n\nTherefore, each student gets 31 apples from the remaining stock. Adding that to the 9 Skittles they already have, each student gets a total of 31 + 9 = 40 apples.\n\nWait, that's the same number as before. So, regardless of whether we consider the Skittles separately or add them in, each student ends up with 40 apples. That makes sense because the Skittles were already part of the initial distribution.\n\nSo, in conclusion, each student gets 40 apples.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{40}","ground_truth":"40","predicted_answer":"40","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}
