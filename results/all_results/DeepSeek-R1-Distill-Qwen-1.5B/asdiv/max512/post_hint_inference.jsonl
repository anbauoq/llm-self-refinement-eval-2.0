It says after burning, he has less than what's left, which might mean that the 450 lbs is less than the total he had before burning. So, to find the original amount, I need to subtract the cement he used or burned from the remaining 450 lbs. But wait, the problem doesn't specify how much he burned or used. Maybe the hint is that the total after adding is less than the remaining, which suggests he burned or used some. So, the original amount would be the remaining 450 lbs minus the amount he used or burned.

Alternatively, if he had more and now has 450, the original amount must be more than 450. But since he only added 215 + 137 = 352, the original must be 352.

Add all these results together to get the final area.\n\nLet me start with step 1: 312 multiplied by 6.\n- 2 * 6 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n- 1 * 6 = 6 plus the carried over 1 makes 7.\n- 3 * 6 = 18.\nSo, 312 * 6 = 1872.\n\nNext, step 2: 312 multiplied by 40.\n- Multiply 312 by 4: 312 * 4 = 1248.\n- Add a zero at the end because we're multiplying by 40: 12480.\n\nStep 3: 312 multiplied by 100.\n- Multiply 312 by 1: 312.\n- Add two zeros at the end: 31200.\n\nNow, add all these results together: 1872 + 12480 + 31200.\n\nLet me add 1872 and 12480 first:\n- 1872 + 12480 = 14352.\n\nThen add 31200 to 14352:\n- 14352 + 31\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many square centimeters of ground the sandbox covers. The sandbox is 312 centimeters long and 146 centimeters wide. Since it's rectangular, the area can be found by multiplying length by width.\n\nFirst, I'll note down the measurements: 312 cm in length and 146 cm in width. Both are in centimeters, so the area will be in square centimeters.\n\nTo find the area, I need to multiply 312 by 146. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nStarting with 312 multiplied by 6 (the units digit of 146):\n- 2 * 6 = 12, write down 2 and carry over 1.\n- 1 * 6 = 6 plus the carried over 1 makes 7.\n- 3 * 6 = 18.\nSo, 312 * 6 = 1872.\n\nNext, 312 multiplied by 40 (the tens digit of 146, which is 4 shifted one place to the left):\n- Multiply 312 by 4: 312 * 4 = 1248.\n- Add a zero at the end: 12480.\n\nThen, 312 multiplied by 100 (the hundreds digit of 146, which is 1 shifted two places to the left):\n- Multiply 312 by 1: 312.\n- Add two zeros at the end: 31200.\n\nNow, add all these results together: 1872 + 12480 + 31200.\n\nAdding 1872 and 12480:\n- 1872 + 12480 = 14352.\n\nAdding 31200 to 14352:\n- 14352 + 31200 = 45552.\n\nSo, the total area of the sandbox is 45552 square centimeters.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{45552}","ground_truth":"45552","predicted_answer":"45552","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

If Jack reads 23 pages a day, how many days does it take him to finish 285 pages? \n\nDividing 285 by 23 gives me approximately 12.39 days. Since he can't read a fraction of a day, it would take him 13 days to finish the book. On the 13th day, he would read the remaining pages. \n\nTo find out how many pages he reads on the 13th day, I can subtract the pages he reads in the first 12 days from the total. 23 times 12 is 276. So, 285 minus 276 equals 9 pages. \n\nWait, now I'm getting 9 pages for the last day, which is different from my earlier answer. I think I made a mistake in assuming he reads for 1\n\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many pages Jack will read on the last day of his 285-page book, reading 23 pages each day. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll determine how many full days Jack can read without exceeding the total number of pages. Since he reads 23 pages per day, I can divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he reads each day.\n\n285 pages divided by 23 pages per day is 12.39 days. Since Jack can't read a fraction of a day, he will finish the book on the 13th day.\n\nNext, I'll calculate how many pages he reads in the first 12 full days. Multiplying 23 pages by 12 days gives me 276 pages.\n\nFinally, to find out how many pages he reads on the last day, I'll subtract the pages he has already read from the total number of pages:\n\n285 total pages minus 276 pages read in 12 days equals 9 pages on the last day.\n\nSo, Jack will read 9 pages on the last day.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{9}","ground_truth":"9","predicted_answer":"9","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

So, the question is: \"650 lollipops are to be distributed to 42 kids. If all the kids share all of the lollipops equally, at least how many more lollipops are needed?\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is asking. We have 650 lollipops and 42 kids. We want to distribute them equally, but if there's any leftover, we need to make sure each kid gets the same amount. So, we have to see if 650 can be evenly divided by 42. If not, we need to find out how many more lollipops are needed to make the total divisible by 42.\n\nLet me try dividing 650 by 42 to see what each kid would get. So, 42 times 15 is 630, and 650 minus 630 is 20. So, there's a remainder of 20. That means if we give each kid 15 lollipops, we'll have 20 lollipops left over. But the problem says we need to distribute them equally, and if there's a remainder, we need to round up to the next whole number to ensure each kid gets the same amount. \n\nSo, instead of giving each kid 15 lollipops, we need to give each kid 16 lollipops.

So, we need 672 lollipops in total. \n\nBut we only have 650 lollipops right now. So, how many more do we need?

So, the question is: \"650 lollipops are to be distributed to 42 kids. If all the kids share all of the lollipops equally, at least how many more lollipops are needed?\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is asking. We have 650 lollipops and 42 kids. We want to distribute them equally, but if there's any leftover, we need to make sure each kid gets the same amount. So, we have to see if 650 can be evenly divided by 42. If not, we need to find out how many more lollipops are needed to make the total divisible by 42.\n\nLet me try dividing 650 by 42 to see what each kid would get. So, 42 times 15 is 630, and 650 minus 630 is 20. So, there's a remainder of 20. That means if we give each kid 15 lollipops, we'll have 20 lollipops left over. But the problem says we need to distribute them equally, and if there's a remainder, we need to round up to the next whole number to ensure each kid gets the same amount. \n\nSo, instead of giving each kid 15 lollipops, we need to give each kid 16 lollipops.

{"id":784,"question":"A library buys 4,305 new books. If it wants to shelve them equally onto 83 shelves, how many more new books should be purchased?","chain_of_thought":"Alright, so I need to figure out how many more books the library should purchase so that they can shelve all the books equally onto 83 shelves without any leftovers. They currently have 4,305 books.\n\nFirst, I should divide the total number of books by the number of shelves to see how many books each shelf can hold. So, I'll do 4,305 divided by 83. \n\nLet me calculate that. 83 times 50 is 4,150. Subtracting that from 4,305 gives me 155. Now, 83 goes into 155 once, which is 83. Subtracting that leaves 72. So, the division gives me a quotient of 51 with a remainder of 72.\n\nSince there's a remainder, it means that the books can't be evenly distributed without some shelves having an extra book. To eliminate the remainder, I need to add the remainder to the total number of books. So, 72 more books will make the total 4,305 + 72 = 4,377.\n\nNow, I'll divide 4,377 by 83 to check if it divides evenly. 83 times 51 is 4,233. Subtracting that from 4,377 gives me 144.

So, 4,233 plus 72 is 4,305. That means the remainder is correct.

So first, I need to divide 4,305 by 83 to see how many books each shelf will have and if there's any remainder.\n\nLet me start by estimating how many times 83 goes into 4,305. 83 times 50 is 4,150. Subtracting that from 4,305 leaves 155. Now, 83 times 1 is 83. Subtracting that from 155 leaves 72. So, 83 goes into 4,305 a total of 51 times with a remainder of 72.\n\nSince there's a remainder, we need to add the remainder to the total number of books to make it divisible by 83. So, 72 books will be added to 4,305, making it 4,377 books in total. Now, dividing 4,377 by 83 should give us a whole number with no remainder.\n\nLet me check: 83 times 51 is 4,233, and adding 72 gives us 4,305. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me try again.\n\nStarting over: 83 times 51 is 4,233. Subtracting that from 4,305 gives a remainder of 72. So, to make it divisible by 83, we need to add 72 to 4,305, making it 4,377. Now, dividing 4,377 by 83 should give us 51 with a remainder of 0.\n\nWait, that still doesn't make sense because 83 times 51 is 4,233, and 4,233 plus 72 is 4,305, which is the original number. I'm getting confused here. Maybe I need to approach it differently.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the division algorithm. When dividing 4,305 by 83, the quotient is 51 and the remainder is 72. To make it divisible,\n\nAlright, so I need to figure out how many more books the library should purchase so that they can shelve all the books equally onto 83 shelves without any leftovers.

Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the balloons come in bags of 20, the horns in 10, and candy bars in 8. I need to find a number that each of these can divide into evenly. That means I need to find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of 20, 10, and 8.\n\nTo find the LCM, I'll start by breaking down each number into its prime factors:\n\n- 20 = 2 × 2 × 5\n- 10 = 2 × 5\n- 8 = 2 × 2 × 2\n\nNow, for the LCM, I take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorizations:\n\n- For 2, the highest power is 2³ (from 8)\n- For 5, the highest power is 5¹ (from 20 and 10)\n\nSo, LCM = 2³ × 5¹ = 8 × 5 = 40\n\nThis means each basket should have 40 balloons, 40 party horns, and 40 candy bars.\n\nNow, let's figure out how many bags or packages Magellan needs for each item:\n\n- Balloons: Each bag has 20, so 40 ÷ 20 = 2 bags\n- Party horns: Each bag has 10, so 40 ÷ 10 = 4 bags\n- Candy bars: Each package has 8, so 40 ÷ 8 = 5 packages\n\nSo, Magellan should buy 2 bags of balloons, 4 bags of party horns, and 5 packages of candy bars to make equal baskets with 40 of each item.\n</think>\n\nTo solve the problem, Magellan needs to determine the number of each item (balloons, party horns, candy bars) that should be in each basket so that each basket has an equal number of each item. \n\n1. **Determine the Least Common Multiple (LCM):**  \n   The goal is to find a common number that each item can be evenly divided into. This is found by calculating the LCM of 20 (balloons), 10 (horns), and\n\nAlright, let me try to figure this out. So, Magellan wants to make party baskets with balloons, party horns, and candy bars. The balloons come in bags of 20, the party horns in bags of 10, and the candy bars in packages of 8. He wants each basket to have the same number of each item. \n\nFirst, I need to find a common number that 20, 10, and 8 can divide into without any leftovers.

So, she needs to pick enough flowers so that the total becomes divisible by 8. \n\nFirst, I need to find out how many extra flowers she needs. To do that, I can divide 601 by 8 and see what the remainder is. \n\nLet me calculate 601 divided by 8. \n\n8 goes into 60 seven times because 8*7=56. Subtract 56 from 60, and we get 4.

Vanessa has 855 quarters and each soda costs 7 quarters. She wants to buy as many sodas as she can with her quarters. To find out how many more quarters she needs to buy the final soda, I'll start by calculating the total cost for all the sodas she wants to buy.\n\nFirst, I'll multiply the number of sodas by the cost per soda:\n855 quarters * 7 quarters per soda = 5985 quarters\n\nNow, Vanessa already has 855 quarters. To find out how many more she needs, I'll subtract the quarters she already has from the total cost:\n5985 quarters - 855 quarters = 5130 quarters\n\nSo, Vanessa needs 5130 more quarters to buy the final soda.","full_output":"Alright, let me figure out how many more quarters Vanessa needs to buy the final soda. She has 855 quarters and each soda costs 7 quarters. So first, I need to find out how much it will cost for 855 sodas. That would be 855 multiplied by 7. Let me do that calculation: 855 * 7.\n\nBreaking it down:\n- 800 * 7 = 5600\n- 50 * 7 = 350\n- 5 * 7 = 35\n\nAdding those together: 5600 + 350 = 5950, and then 5950 + 35 = 5985.

I think this means he takes less time by biking, so I need to find out how much less time that is.\n\nThe hint says that the saved time is 64 minutes, so I need to subtract this from the walking time to find out the time saved. Wait, no, actually, the saved time is the amount he reduces by biking. So, if he walks in 98 minutes and bikes in 64 minutes less, then the time saved is 64 minutes.\n\nBut let me make sure. If biking saves 64 minutes, that means biking takes 64 minutes less than walking. So, biking time = walking time - saved time = 98 - 64 = 34 minutes. Therefore, biking saves 64 minutes compared to walking.\n\nWait, but the question is asking how much time he saved, which is 64 minutes. So, is that the answer? Or is it asking how much time he actually spends biking?\n\nThe question says, \"How much time did Mike save?\" So, it's asking for the amount of time saved by biking, which is 64 minutes. So, the answer is 64 minutes.\n\nAlternatively, if I wanted to find out how much time he actually spends biking, I would subtract the saved time from the walking time: 98 - 64 = 34 minutes. So, biking takes 34 minutes, and he saved 64 minutes by biking.\n\nBut the question is specifically asking how much time he saved, so the answer is 64 minutes.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. If he takes 98 minutes to walk and 34 minutes to bike, then the time saved is 98 - 34 = 64 minutes. Yes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, the time saved is 64 minutes.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{64}","ground_truth":"34","predicted_answer":"64","is_correct":false,"was_retried":true}
