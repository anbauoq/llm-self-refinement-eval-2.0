We have 7 rows of strawberry plants, and each row produces 268 kg of fruit. We need to find the total yield from all 7 rows combined.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is by using multiplication. Since each row produces the same amount, we can multiply the yield per row by the number of rows. That makes sense because it's like adding the same number multiple times, which is essentially what multiplication is.\n\nSo, if each row gives 268 kg, and there are 7 rows, then the total yield should be 268 multiplied by 7. \n\nLet me write that down:\n\nTotal yield = 268 kg/row * 7 rows\n\nCalculating that:\n\n268 * 7 = 1876\n\nSo, the total yield from all 7 rows is 1876 kg.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to make sure I didn't make a mistake. \n\n268 * 7:\n\nFirst, multiply 200 * 7 = 1400\n\nThen, 60 * 7 = 420\n\nNext, 8 * 7 = 56\n\nNow, add them up: 1400 + 420 = 1820, and 1820 + 56 = 1876\n\nYes, that checks out. So, the total yield is indeed 1876 kg.\n\nI don't see any other way to approach this problem. It's straightforward multiplication. There's no need to consider any additional factors since the problem doesn't mention anything else affecting the yield.\n\nSo, the final answer is 1876 kg.","full_output":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step.

That means I'll calculate 495 divided by 25. \n\nLet me write that down: 495 ÷ 25.\n\nNow, I'll perform the division step by step. 25 goes into 495 how many times? \n\n25 times 19 is 475 because 25*10=250 and 25*9=225, so adding them gives 475. \n\nSubtracting 475 from 495 leaves me with 20. \n\nSince there's a remainder of 20, which is less than 25, Mr. Lee can't fill another complete basket with 25 apples. Therefore, he needs an additional basket for the remaining 20 apples.\n\nSo, the total number of baskets required is 19 (for the 475 apples) plus 1 (for the remaining 20 apples), which equals 20 baskets.\n\nTo double-check, if each basket has 25 apples and there are 20 baskets, the total number of apples would be 20 * 25 = 500. But Mr. Lee only has 495 apples, so we need to adjust. \n\nWait, that can't be right. Let me correct that. If 19 baskets have 25 apples each, that's 19 * 25 = 475 apples. Adding one more basket gives us 20 baskets, which would be 20 * 25 = 500 apples. But Mr. Lee only has 495 apples, so he can't fill the 20th basket completely.

{"id":776,"question":"A ballet class wants to divide its 90 members into some large groups at 7 members each and some small groups at 3 members each. In order to make the least number of groups, how many large groups should be made?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have a total of 90 members in the garden, and we need to divide them into large groups of 7 and small groups of 3. The goal is to make the least number of groups possible. \n\nFirst, I think I should figure out how many large groups and small groups we can have without any leftovers. That means 90 should be perfectly divisible by the combination of 7 and 3 in some way. But since 7 and 3 are co-prime, it might be a bit tricky to make it perfectly divisible. \n\nMaybe I can set up an equation to represent this situation. Let’s say L is the number of large groups and S is the number of small groups. So, the total number of members would be 7L + 3S = 90. Our goal is to minimize L + S.\n\nHmm, I need to find integer values for L and S that satisfy this equation. Since 7 and 3 are both divisors, perhaps I can manipulate the equation to find suitable integers. Let me try rearranging the equation:\n\n7L + 3S = 90\n\nMaybe I can solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for S:\n\n3S = 90 - 7L\nS = (90 - 7L) / 3\n\nSince S has to be an integer, (90 - 7L) must be divisible by 3. Let's think about the divisibility rule for 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. So, 90 is already divisible by 3 (90 ÷ 3 = 30), which means 7L must also be divisible by 3 for (90 - 7L) to be divisible by 3. \n\nNow, 7 and 3 are co-prime, so for 7L to be divisible by 3, L must be a multiple of 3. That makes sense because 7 doesn't have any factors in common with 3. So, L has to be 3, 6, 9, etc., up to a point where 7L doesn't exceed 90.\n\nLet me try L = 12 first, which is a multiple of 3. Plugging that in:\n\n7*12 = 84\nS = (90 - 84)/3 = 6/3 = 2\n\nSo, with L = 12 and S = 2, we have 12 large groups and 2 small groups. Total groups = 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nWait, is that the minimum? Let me check if there's a smaller number of groups. Let's try L = 9:\n\n7*9 = 63\nS = (90 - 63)/3 = 27/3 = 9\n\nTotal groups = 9 + 9 = 18.

That means he needs to distribute 18 more riddles.\n\nTherefore, Sam needs to distribute 18 more riddles to ensure each student gets the same number.\n</think>\n\nSam needs to distribute 18 more riddles.\n\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, Sam has 389 riddles and wants to distribute them equally among his 18 students. He wants each student to guess the same number of riddles. \n\nFirst, I think I need to find out how many riddles each student would get if he divides them equally. To do that, I'll divide the total number of riddles by the number of students. So, 389 divided by 18. Let me calculate that.\n\n389 ÷ 18 = 21.611...\n\nHmm, that means each student would get approximately 21.611 riddles. But since you can't have a fraction of a riddle, Sam needs to give each student whole riddles. So, if each student gets 21 riddles, that would be 21 × 18 = 378 riddles in total. \n\nNow, to find out how many more riddles Sam needs, I subtract the number of riddles he already has from the total needed. So, 378 - 389 = -11. Wait, that can't be right because we can't have a negative number of riddles. Maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me check again. 389 ÷ 18 is approximately 21.611, so rounding up, each student gets 22 riddles. Then, 22 × 18 = 396 riddles in total. \n\nNow, subtracting the riddles Sam already has: 396 - 389 = 7. So, Sam needs to distribute 7 more riddles to ensure each student gets the same number of riddles.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought it was 18 more. I think I confused the direction of the calculation. The correct answer should be 7 more riddles.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{7}","ground_truth":"7","predicted_answer":"7","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

For example, if Guide A spoke to 19 children and Guide B spoke to 25 children, the total would be 19 + 25 = 44 children. But the hint says to multiply by the number of guides, which would be 22. That would give me 22 times the number of children each guide spoke to, which is not how it should work.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the hint. It says each guide spoke to a specific number of children, but the total is the sum of all children each guide spoke to. So I just need to add 19 and 25 together. Let me calculate that.\n\n19 (from the first guide) plus 25 (from the second guide) equals 44. So the total number of children the zoo guides spoke to is 44.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{44}","ground_truth":"44","predicted_answer":"44","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

So, the problem says that ten years ago, the sum of the ages of two sons was one-third of their father's age. Right now, the sum of their ages is 14 years less than the father's current age. Hmm, that's a bit complex, but let's break it down.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let me call the current age of the younger son as Y, the older son as Y + 2 (since he's two years older), and the father's current age as F.\n\nNow, ten years ago, the younger son would have been Y - 10 years old, and the older son would have been (Y + 2) - 10 = Y - 8 years old. The father would have been F - 10 years old at that time.\n\nAccording to the problem, the sum of the sons' ages ten years ago was one-third of the father's age then. So, I can write that as:\n\n(Y - 10) + (Y - 8) = (1/3)(F - 10)\n\nSimplifying the left side: 2Y - 18 = (1/3)(F - 10)\n\nNow, the problem also states that the sum of their present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age.

Inside this square, he's drawn a circle that touches each side of the square. That means the circle is perfectly inscribed within the square. \n\nFirst, I need to find the side length of the square. Since the area of a square is given by the formula \\( \\text{Area} = \\text{side}^2 \\), I can find the side length by taking the square root of the area.

We need to divide this by 5 to find the amount per glass. So, 153 divided by 5. Let me do the division: 5 goes into 15 three times, so I write down 3, subtract 15, bring down the next digit which is 3, making it 33. 5 goes into 33 six times, so I write down 6, subtract 30, bring down the next digit which is 3, making it 33 again. 5 goes into 33 six times again, so I write down another 6.

{"id":1371,"question":"A company was buying new uniforms for its employees. They bought 121 uniforms total for their 32 stores. About how many uniforms should each store get?","chain_of_thought":"Alright, let's break this down step by step. The company bought 121 uniforms for 32 stores and needs to distribute them evenly. To find out how many uniforms each store should get, I need to divide the total number of uniforms by the number of stores.\n\nSo, I'll perform the division: 121 divided by 32. Let me calculate that. \n\n121 ÷ 32 equals 3.78125. Hmm, that's a decimal. But since uniforms can't be split, I need to round this up to ensure all uniforms are allocated. \n\nRounding up 3.78125 gives me 4. That means each store should get 4 uniforms. But wait, let me check if 32 stores times 4 uniforms each equals the total number of uniforms bought.\n\n32 stores * 4 uniforms = 128 uniforms. But the company only bought 121 uniforms. Oh, that's a problem. I rounded up too much. I need to make sure the total doesn't exceed 121.\n\nSo, if I give each store 3 uniforms, that would be 32 * 3 = 96 uniforms. Then, I have 121 - 96 = 25 uniforms left.

Let me calculate that. \n\n121 ÷ 32 equals 3.78125. Hmm, that's a decimal. But since uniforms can't be split, I need to round this up to ensure all uniforms are allocated. \n\nRounding up 3.78125 gives me 4. That means each store should get 4 uniforms.

Oh, that's a problem. I rounded up too much. I need to make sure the total doesn't exceed 121.\n\nSo, if I give each store 3 uniforms, that would be 32 * 3 = 96 uniforms.

Let me do that calculation: 45 ÷ 18 equals 2.5. Wait, that's not a whole number, so Sean can't give half a Starburst to each friend. That means he can't distribute them equally in whole numbers.

Maybe I need to consider that he only gives out 36 Starbursts, and eats the remaining 9. But the final answer is supposed to be <MSK>, which suggests each friend got <MSK> and Sean ate 0.

So, maybe the problem intended for each friend to get <MSK>, and Sean ate 0, leaving 36 Starbursts given out.

But the correct answer is <MSK>, so maybe each friend got <MSK>.5, but that's not possible. I'm stuck here.

Let me try to think differently. Maybe Sean only ate 0, so he gave out all 45 Starbursts, but that's not equal to 18 friends. So, 45 divided by 18 is 2.5, which isn't possible. So, he gives 2 to each, leaving 9. But the final answer is <MSK>, which suggests each friend got <MSK>, and Sean ate 0. So, maybe the question was different, like Sean only ate 0, so the total given out is 45. But that doesn't make sense because 18 friends times <MSK> is 36, not 45. I'm stuck.

Hmm, let's see. To figure out how many each friend gets, I need to divide the total number of Starbursts by the number of friends. So that's 45 divided by 18. Let me do that calculation: 45 ÷ 18 equals 2.5. Wait, that's not a whole number, so Sean can't give half a Starburst to each friend. That means he can't distribute them equally in whole numbers. So, he would give 2 Starbursts to each friend, which uses up 36 Starbursts (since 18 friends × 2 Starbursts = 36). That leaves him with 9 Starbursts. But the problem says he eats what's left, so he eats those 9. But the correct answer is supposed to be something else. Maybe I need to consider that he only gives out 36 Starbursts, and eats the remaining 9. But the final answer is supposed to be <MSK>, which suggests each friend got <MSK> and Sean ate 0.
