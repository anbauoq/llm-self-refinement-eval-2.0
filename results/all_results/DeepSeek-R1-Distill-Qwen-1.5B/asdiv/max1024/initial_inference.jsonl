Next, she can use a nickel, which is 5 cents. Subtracting that, she has 7 - 5 = 2 cents left. Finally, she can use two pennies to cover the remaining 2 cents. \n\nSo, adding up the coins: 1 dime, 1 nickel, and 2 pennies. That makes a total of 4 coins. \n\nWait, let me double-check. 1 dime is 10, 1 nickel is 5, and 2 pennies are 2. 10 + 5 + 2 = 17, which matches the total cost. So yes, she used 4 coins in total.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{4}","ground_truth":"4","predicted_answer":"4","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

{"id":159,"question":"I have 28 cents in my pocket. How coins could I have on minimization?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I have 28 cents in my pocket, and I need to figure out the different combinations of coins that add up to exactly 28 cents. I'm trying to minimize the number of coins, so I guess I want to use the fewest number of coins possible. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the smallest denomination in US coins is a penny, which is 1 cent. If I have 28 pennies, that would be the maximum, but that's obviously not the most efficient way because using higher denomination coins would use fewer coins. So, I should aim to use as many of the higher denominations as possible.\n\nNext, the nickel is 5 cents. If I use as many nickels as I can, that should help minimize the number of coins. Let me see how many nickels fit into 28 cents. Dividing 28 by 5 gives me 5 with a remainder of 3. So, I can use 5 nickels, which is 25 cents, and then I have 3 cents left.\n\nNow, for the remaining 3 cents, the smallest coin is a penny. So, I can use 3 pennies. That adds up to 5 nickels and 3 pennies, totaling 8 coins.\n\nWait, but is there a way to use fewer coins? Let me check. If I use 4 nickels, that would be 20 cents, leaving me with 8 cents. 8 cents can be made with 1 quarter, but that's more than 8 cents. Alternatively, 8 pennies would give me 8 cents, which would make the total coins 4 nickels + 8 pennies = 12 coins, which is more than the previous combination. So, using 5 nickels and 3 pennies is better.\n\nAnother thought: could I use a dime instead of some nickels? A dime is 10 cents. If I use 2 dimes, that's 20 cents, leaving 8 cents. 8 cents can be made with 8 pennies, so that would be 2 dimes + 8 pennies = 10 coins, which is more than 8 coins. So, the initial combination of 5 nickels and 3 pennies is better.\n\nWhat if I try using a quarter? A quarter is 25 cents, leaving 3 cents, which is 3 pennies. So, that would be 1 quarter and 3 pennies, totaling 4 coins. That's actually fewer coins than the previous combinations. Wait, that's even better!\n\nHold on, let me verify that. A quarter is 25 cents, and 3 pennies make 3 cents, totaling 28 cents. So that's 1 quarter + 3 pennies = 4 coins. That's fewer than the previous 8 coins.\n\nBut wait, I thought 28 cents was the total. So, using a quarter and 3 pennies would indeed make 28 cents, and that's 4 coins. That seems better than the 8 coins I had before.\n\nLet me check if there's a way to use even fewer coins. If I use 1 dime, that's 10 cents, leaving 18 cents. 18 cents can be made with 3 dimes and 3 pennies, which would be 4 coins (1 dime + 3 dimes + 3 pennies = 4 coins), but that's still 4 coins. Alternatively, using quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, but I think the quarter is the most efficient.\n\nWait, no, using a quarter is better than using dimes and nickels because a quarter is 25 cents, which is more than a dime and a nickel combined (15 cents). So, using a quarter and 3 pennies is more efficient.\n\nSo, the combination of 1 quarter and 3 pennies gives me 4 coins, which is the minimum number of coins needed to make 28 cents.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. 1 quarter is 25 cents, and 3 pennies are 3 cents, so 25 + 3 = 28 cents. That's correct. And 1 quarter is 25 cents, which is a standard coin.

I need to find out how many more students that is compared to the number he met before recess.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the numbers:\n\n- Second graders: 14\n- Fourth graders: 10\n- Fifth graders: 16\n\nTo find out how many more students that is, I need to add up the number of students Buddy met during recess and then compare it to the number he met before recess.

Let's just add up the students he met during recess.\n\nSo, 14 second graders plus 10 fourth graders plus 16 fifth graders. Let me add them step by step.\n\n14 plus 10 is 24. Then, 24 plus 16 is 40. So, Buddy met a total of 40 students during recess.\n\nBut the question is asking how many more students did he meet during recess, implying that before recess he might have met some number. Since the question doesn't provide that number, I can't determine how many more he met beyond what he met before. Maybe the question is incomplete or missing information.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I'm supposed to assume that he met zero students before recess, making the total number of students he met during recess the answer. In that case, it's 40 students.\n\nWait, but the question is a bit ambiguous.

So, the question is about Buddy meeting students during recess. He met 14 second graders, 10 fourth graders, and 16 fifth graders.

That would be 14 (second graders) plus 10 (fourth graders) plus 16 (fifth graders). Let me add those up: 14 plus 10 is 24, and then adding 16 gives me 40. So, Buddy met a total of 40 students during recess.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking how many more students he met compared to the ones he directly met.

Without knowing the total number of students, I can't determine how many more students he met beyond the ones he met.\n\nSo, since I don't have the total number of students in the cafeteria, I can't calculate the difference.

If she has $50.00 left from the money she had after buying cookies, and she has $69.00 before, how much did she spend on juice?\n\nFirst, let's break down the information:\n\n1. She had $69.00 before buying refreshments.\n2. After buying refreshments, she has $50.00 left.\n3. The question is asking how much she spent on juice.\n\nOkay, so if she had $69.00 and now has $50.00, that means she spent some money on refreshments. To find out how much she spent, I subtract the final amount from the initial amount:\n\n$69.00 (initial amount) - $50.00 (remaining amount) = $19.00 (total spent on refreshments).\n\nNow, the problem is asking how much she spent on juice, but it doesn't specify how much she spent on cookies. It only tells me that she spent $19.00 in total on refreshments. Without knowing how much she spent on cookies, I can't determine how much she spent on juice.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to assume that she didn't spend any money on cookies. But that doesn't make sense because the problem says she bought refreshments, which probably includes cookies and juice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she spent all her $19.00 on juice.

If I don't know how much she spent on cookies, I can't figure out how much she spent on juice. \n\nI'm not sure how to proceed without more information. Maybe the problem is missing some details. \n\nI think the answer is that she spent $19.00 on refreshments in total, but without knowing how much she spent on cookies, I can't determine how much she spent on juice. \n\nSo, I'm stuck because the problem doesn't provide enough information to find the exact amount spent on juice.","full_output":"Okay, let's try to figure out how much her friends spent on juice.

So, she spent $19.00 on cookies. \n\nNow, the question is asking how much she spent on juice. Since she bought refreshments for her friends and spent $19.00 on cookies, but the problem doesn't specify how much she spent on juice directly, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I need to assume that the $50.00 is the total she had after buying the refreshments, which includes both cookies and juice. \n\nIf she had $69.00 before buying refreshments and ended up with $50.00, that means she spent $19.00 on refreshments altogether. If $19.00 is the total she spent on cookies and juice, and we know she spent $19.00 on cookies, then she didn't spend anything on juice. That seems odd because she would have no money left for juice. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the $50.00 is the amount she had after buying the refreshments, including juice. If she had $69.00 before, and after buying refreshments she has $50.00, then she spent $19.00 on refreshments. But without knowing how much she spent on juice specifically, I can't determine the exact amount. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that she bought both cookies and juice, and the $19.00 she spent on cookies is part of the $50.00 she had after buying refreshments. So, she had $69.00 before, and after buying refreshments, she had $50.00, meaning she spent $19.00 on refreshments. If she spent $19.00 on cookies, then the rest of that $19.00 was on juice. But the problem doesn't specify how much she spent on juice, so I'm not sure how to proceed. Maybe the question is missing some information, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.\n\nAnother way to look at it is that she bought refreshments totaling $50.00, and she already spent $19.00 on cookies. Therefore, the amount she spent on juice would be the remaining $31.00, because $50.00 minus $19.00 equals $31.00. But the question specifically asks how much she spent on juice, not the total amount. So I'm still a bit confused.\n\nWait, maybe I need to clarify: She had $69.00 before buying refreshments, and after buying refreshments, she has $50.00 left. That means she spent $19.00 on refreshments in total. If she bought cookies for $19.00 and juice for, say, x dollars, then x would be the amount she spent on juice. But without knowing how much she spent on cookies specifically, I can't determine x. \n\nAlternatively, if she spent $19.00 on cookies and juice combined, and she didn't spend any money on juice, that doesn't make sense. So perhaps the problem is that she bought both cookies and juice, and the total she spent on refreshments is $50.00, with $19.00 going to cookies. Therefore, she spent $31.00 on juice. \n\nBut the question is asking specifically how much she spent on juice, not the total. So if she spent $19.00 on cookies, the rest of the $50.00 would have been on juice, which would be $31.00. But since the problem doesn't specify how much she spent on cookies, I can't determine the exact amount spent on juice. \n\nI'm a bit stuck here because the information provided isn't enough to find the exact amount spent on juice. The only clear number I have is $50.00, which is the total she had after buying refreshments. If she had $69.00 before and spent $19.00 on cookies, then she spent $31.00 on juice, but I don't know if that's the case. \n\nMaybe I need to assume that the $50.00 is the total spent on refreshments, including both cookies and juice. So if she had $69.00 before and ended up with $5\n\nOkay, so I have this problem here: Her friends are coming over the next day so she also bought some refreshments. If she has $50.00 left from the money she had after buying cookies, and she has $69.00 before, how much did she spend on juice?\n\nAlright, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nFirst, she had $69.00 before buying refreshments. After buying refreshments, she has $50.00 left. That means she spent some money on refreshments. To find out how much she spent, I can subtract the final amount she has from the initial amount she had. So, $69.00 minus $50.00 equals $19.00. So, she spent $19.00 on refreshments in total.\n\nNow, the question is asking how much she spent on juice. But wait, the problem doesn't specify how much she spent on cookies specifically. It only tells me she spent $19.00 on refreshments in total. Without knowing how much she spent on cookies, I can't determine how much she spent on juice. \n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me read the question again: \"Her friends are coming over the next day so she also bought some refreshments. If she has $50.00 left from the money she had after buying cookies, and she has $69.00 before, how much did she spend on juice?\"\n\nSo, she had $69.00 before buying refreshments. After buying refreshments, she has $50.00 left. So, she spent $19.00 on refreshments. But the question is about how much she spent on juice. It doesn't specify how much she spent on cookies or juice individually. \n\nWait a minute, maybe she bought cookies and juice, and the $19.00 she spent on refreshments includes both. If I assume that she spent all of her $19.00 on juice, then she didn't have enough money for cookies. But she did buy cookies, so that doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, if she spent some money on cookies and the rest on juice, but since the problem doesn't specify how much she spent on cookies, I can't figure out how much she spent on juice. \n\nMaybe I need to make an assumption. Let's say she spent $10.00 on cookies. Then, if she spent $19.00 in total, she would have spent $9.00 on juice. But the problem doesn't specify how much she spent on cookies, so I can't be sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the $19.00 she spent on refreshments includes both cookies and juice. If I don't know how much she spent on cookies, I can't determine how much she spent on juice. \n\nWait, perhaps the problem is that she bought both cookies and juice, and the total she spent on refreshments is $50.00, with $19.00 going to cookies. Therefore, she spent $31.00 on juice. But the question is specifically asking how much she spent on juice, not the total. \n\nI'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I need to look at the problem again. \n\nShe had $69.00 before buying refreshments. After buying refreshments, she has $50.00 left. So, she spent $19.00 on refreshments. If she bought cookies and juice, and the total she spent is $19.00, then without knowing how much she spent on cookies, I can't figure out how much she spent on juice.\n\nUnless the problem implies that she spent all of her $19.00 on juice, which doesn't make sense because she bought cookies. Or maybe the $19.00 is the total she spent on both cookies and juice. But the problem doesn't specify how much she spent on cookies, so I can't determine how much she spent on juice.\n\nI'm stuck here because the information provided isn't enough to find the exact amount spent on juice. The only clear number I have is $50.00, which is the total she had after buying refreshments. If she had $69.00 before and spent $19.00 on refreshments, she spent $31.00 on juice, but I don't know if that's the case. \n\nMaybe the problem is missing some details, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it. Without knowing how much she spent on cookies specifically, I can't determine the exact amount she spent on juice. \n\nI think the best I can do is assume that she spent all of her $19.00 on juice, but that seems unlikely because she bought cookies. Alternatively\n\nOkay, let me try to figure this out step by step. \n\nSo, the problem is: Her friends are coming over the next day so she also bought some refreshments. If she has $50.00 left from the money she had after buying cookies, and she has $69.00 before, how much did she spend on juice?\n\nFirst, let's break down the information:\n\n1. She had $69.00 before buying refreshments.\n2. After buying refreshments, she has $50.00 left.\n3. The question is asking how much she spent on juice.\n\nOkay, so if she had $69.00 and now has $50.00, that means she spent some money on refreshments. To find out how much she spent, I subtract the final amount from the initial amount:\n\n$69.00 (initial amount) - $50.00 (remaining amount) = $19.00 (total spent on refreshments).\n\nNow, the problem is asking how much she spent on juice, but it doesn't specify how much she spent on cookies. It only tells me that she spent $19.00 in total on refreshments. Without knowing how much she spent on cookies, I can't determine how much she spent on juice.\n\nHmm, this is a bit confusing. Maybe I need to assume that she didn't spend any money on cookies. But that doesn't make sense because the problem says she bought refreshments, which probably includes cookies and juice.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she spent all her $19.00 on juice. But that seems unlikely because she bought cookies. \n\nWait, maybe the $19.00 is the total she spent on both cookies and juice. If I don't know how much she spent on cookies, I can't figure out how much she spent on juice. \n\nI'm not sure how to proceed without more information. Maybe the problem is missing some details. \n\nI think the answer is that she spent $19.00 on refreshments in total, but without knowing how much she spent on cookies, I can't determine how much she spent on juice. \n\nSo, I'm stuck because the problem doesn't provide enough information to find the exact amount spent on juice.\n</think>\n\nThe problem doesn't provide enough information to determine how much she spent on juice because it doesn't specify how much she spent on cookies. Without that detail, we can't calculate the exact amount spent on juice.\n\n\\boxed{19}","ground_truth":"19","predicted_answer":"19","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

Since Ben was asked to count the number of cows in each herd, it makes more sense that \"40 cows for every cow herd\" refers to 40 cows per herd. \n\nSo, if each herd has 40 cows and there are 8 herds, I can calculate the total number of cows by multiplying the number of cows per herd by the number of herds. \n\nLet me write that down: 40 cows/herd * 8 herds = 320 cows.\n\nWait, that seems high. Let me double-check. If each herd has 40 cows and there are 8 herds, multiplying 40 by 8 should give the total number of cows. Yeah, 40 times 8 is indeed 320. \n\nI don't think there's any other interpretation of the question that would make sense. It's unlikely that they meant 40 cows in total for all herds, because that would be 5 cows per herd, which doesn't align with the wording. \n\nSo, to summarize, Ben saw 40 cows in each of the 8 herds, so the total number of cows is 40 multiplied by 8, which equals 320. \n\nI don't see any other way to interpret \"40 cows for every cow herd.\" It must mean 40 cows per herd. Therefore, the total number of cows is 320.","full_output":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many cows Ben saw on the farm. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.

So, each guest gets 2 croissants.\n\nNext, to find out how many croissants are left, I'll subtract the total number given out from the original amount. Each guest gets 2 croissants, so 7 guests would get 7 times 2, which is 14 croissants. Subtracting that from 17 gives me 17 - 14 = 3.\n\nSo, after serving the croissants, Cristina will have 3 left.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{3}","ground_truth":"3","predicted_answer":"3","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

That's straightforward: 544 × 2 = 1,088.\n\nNow, add those two results together: 16,320 + 1,088 = 17,408.\n\nWait, that seems a bit high. Let me double-check my calculations. Maybe I should try multiplying 544 by 32 directly.\n\nStarting with 544 × 32:\n\n- Multiply 544 by 2: 544 × 2 = 1,088.\n- Multiply 544 by 30: 544 × 30 = 16,320.\n- Adding them together: 1,088 + 16,320 = 17,408.\n\nHmm, the same result. Let me try another method to confirm. Maybe break down 544 further:\n\n544 = 500 + 44\n\nSo, 500 × 32 = 16,000\n\n44 × 32 = 1,408\n\nAdding them together: 16,000 + 1,408 = 17,408\n\nOkay, still getting 17,408. That seems correct. So, the total number of flowers in all the pots is 17,408.\n\nWait, but let me think again. 544 pots with 32 flowers each. If I have 544 pots and each has 32 flowers, then the total number of flowers is indeed 544 × 32, which is 17,408.\n\nI think I've got it right. So, the final answer is 17,408 flowers.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{17408}","ground_truth":"17408","predicted_answer":"17408","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

So, mathematically, it's 45 multiplied by 23. Let me do that multiplication step by step to make sure I don't make a mistake.\n\nStarting with 45 times 20, that's 900. Then, 45 times 3 is 135.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's identify the number of children and adults. There are 4 children and 3 adults. Child tickets are $3 each, and adult tickets are $6 each. So, I need to calculate the cost for each group separately and then add them together.\n\nStarting with the children: There are 4 children, and each ticket is $3. So, the total cost for the children's tickets would be 4 multiplied by $3. Let me write that down: 4 * $3.

If I have 935 pencils and divide them into 9 equal parts, each part is 935/9. Let me calculate that again. 9 times 100 is 900, so 935 minus 900 is 35. 35 divided by 9 is 3 with a remainder of 8. So each classroom gets 103 pencils, and the remainder is 8. So yes, the library gets 8 pencils.\n\nBut wait, 8 seems a bit small. Let me think again. If 9 classrooms each get 103 pencils, that's 9*103=927 pencils. Then the library gets 935-927=8 pencils. Yeah, that's correct.\n\nWait, but I think I might have made a mistake in the division. Let me try a different approach. 935 divided by 9. Let me do the long division:\n\n9 | 935\n- 9\n---\n03\n- 0\n---\n35\n- 27 (9*3)\n---\n8\n\nSo, 935 divided by 9 is 103 with a remainder of 8. So yes, the library gets 8 pencils.\n</think>\n\nThe company donates a total of 935 pencils. These are divided evenly among 9 classrooms, and the remaining pencils are given to the library.\n\nFirst, divide the total number of pencils by the number of classrooms:\n\\[\n\\frac{935}{9} = 103 \\text{ pencils per classroom with a remainder of } 8.\n\\]\n\nThe remainder of 8 pencils is given to the library.\n\n\\boxed{8}","ground_truth":"8","predicted_answer":"8","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Let me do that calculation:\n\n757 ÷ 65 = ?\n\nHmm, 65 times 11 is 715 because 65 * 10 is 650, and adding another 65 gives 715. Subtracting that from 757 gives me 757 - 715 = 42. So, there's 42 pounds left after filling 11 bags.\n\nSince 42 pounds is less than the full capacity of 65 pounds, I can't fill another full bag. Therefore, I'll need an extra bag to hold the remaining 42 pounds.\n\nAdding that up, I need 11 full bags and 1 extra bag, which totals 12 bags. Let me double-check that:\n\n11 bags * 65 pounds = 715 pounds\n12 bags * 65 pounds = 780 pounds\n\nSince 757 pounds is less than 780 pounds, 12 bags should be sufficient. But since 757 is more than 715, 11 bags aren't enough, so 12 bags are indeed needed.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me verify the division again to make sure. 65 times 11 is 715, and 757 minus 715 is 42. So, 757 divided by 65 is 11 with a remainder of 42. That means 11 full bags and 1 partial bag. Since you can't have a fraction of a bag, you have to round up to the next whole number, which is 12.\n\nSo, yes, 12 bags are needed to hold all 757 pounds of sand.","full_output":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many bags of sand are needed to carry 757 pounds of sand when each bag can hold up to 65 pounds.

But since the bags can hold 16 each, he doesn't need a fraction of a bag. So, 19 bags are enough. \n\nWait, but 16*18 is 288, which is less than 292, so he needs one more bag. So, 18 bags can hold 288, and he needs 1 more to hold the remaining 4. So, total is 19 bags.\n\nBut hold on, the exact calculation is 292 ÷ 16 = 18.25.

Let me read it again carefully to make sure I understand what's being asked.\n\n\"There were 44 laptops in the shop, and Mike divided them equally into 5 rows. How many laptops are there in each row?\"\n\nAlright, so Mike has 44 laptops, and he wants to split them into 5 equal rows. I need to figure out how many laptops will be in each row.\n\nFirst, I think I need to divide the total number of laptops by the number of rows. That makes sense because if he's dividing them equally, each row should have the same number of laptops. So, the problem is essentially asking for 44 divided by 5.\n\nLet me write that down: 44 ÷ 5.\n\nHmm, doing the division in my head, 5 goes into 44 how many times? Well, 5 times 8 is 40, which is less than 44. If I subtract 40 from 44, I get 4. So, there's a remainder of 4.\n\nWait, does the question specify whether the division needs to be exact or if we can have a remainder? The problem says Mike divided them equally into 5 rows, which might mean that the division is exact, but 44 divided by 5 doesn't result in a whole number. So, maybe I need to express the answer as a decimal or a fraction.\n\nLet me think about it. If I divide 44 by 5, I can write it as 44/5. That simplifies to 8 and 4/5. Alternatively, as a decimal, that's 8.8.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the format of the answer. It just says to put the final numeric answer inside a box. Since it's a straightforward division, I can present it as 8.8 or 8 and 4/5, but likely as a decimal because it's more concise.\n\nWait, let me double-check my division to be sure. 5 times 8 is 40, subtract that from 44, you get 4. Bring down a zero, making it 40. 5 goes into 40 exactly 8 times. So, actually, it's 8.8 exactly. So, the answer is 8.8 laptops per row.\n\nBut, wait, can you have a fraction of a laptop in a row? The problem doesn't specify, but in real-life scenarios, you can't have a fraction of a laptop. Maybe it's acceptable to have 8.8, meaning 8 whole laptops in each row and a portion of the 9th laptop.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider integer division, 44 divided by 5 is 8 with a remainder of 4, which means each row has 8 laptops, and there are 4 left over. But the problem doesn't mention remainders, so I think the expected answer is 8.8.\n\nI think I'm confident that 8.8 is the correct answer here.","full_output":"Okay, so I've got this math problem here that I need to solve.

How many laptops are there in each row?\"\n\nAlright, so Mike has 44 laptops, and he wants to split them into 5 equal rows. I need to figure out how many laptops will be in each row.\n\nFirst, I think I need to divide the total number of laptops by the number of rows. That makes sense because if he's dividing them equally, each row should have the same number of laptops. So, the problem is essentially asking for 44 divided by 5.\n\nLet me write that down: 44 ÷ 5.\n\nHmm, doing the division in my head, 5 goes into 44 how many times? Well, 5 times 8 is 40, which is less than 44. If I subtract 40 from 44, I get 4. So, there's a remainder of 4.\n\nWait, does the question specify whether the division needs to be exact or if we can have a remainder? The problem says Mike divided them equally into 5 rows, which might mean that the division is exact, but 44 divided by 5 doesn't result in a whole number. So, maybe I need to express the answer as a decimal or a fraction.\n\nLet me think about it. If I divide 44 by 5, I can write it as 44/5. That simplifies to 8 and 4/5. Alternatively, as a decimal, that's 8.8.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify the format of the answer. It just says to put the final numeric answer inside a box. Since it's a straightforward division, I can present it as 8.8 or 8 and 4/5, but likely as a decimal because it's more concise.\n\nWait, let me double-check my division to be sure. 5 times 8 is 40, subtract that from 44, you get 4. Bring down a zero, making it 40. 5 goes into 40 exactly 8 times. So, actually, it's 8.8 exactly. So, the answer is 8.8 laptops per row.\n\nBut, wait, can you have a fraction of a laptop in a row? The problem doesn't specify, but in real-life scenarios, you can't have a fraction of a laptop. Maybe it's acceptable to have 8.8, meaning 8 whole laptops in each row and a portion of the 9th laptop.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider integer division, 44 divided by 5 is 8 with a remainder of 4, which means each row has 8 laptops, and there are 4 left over. But the problem doesn't mention remainders, so I think the expected answer is 8.8.\n\nI think I'm confident that 8.8 is the correct answer here.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{8.8}","ground_truth":"8","predicted_answer":"8.8","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

Let me denote the number of large rooms as L and the number of small rooms as S. Each large room can hold 3 people, and each small room can hold 2 people. The total number of people is 26, so the equation would be:\n\n3L + 2S = 26\n\nMy goal is to find non-negative integers L and S that satisfy this equation, and I want to minimize the total number of rooms, which is L + S.\n\nTo solve this, I can try different values of L and see if S turns out to be an integer. Since the number of people must be exactly divisible by the room capacities, S must be an integer.\n\nLet me start with L=0:\n\nIf L=0, then 3*0 + 2S = 26  \nSo, 2S = 26  \nTherefore, S = 13\n\nTotal rooms = 0 + 13 = 13\n\nOkay, that's one possibility.

There are two types of rooms: large rooms that can hold 3 people each and small rooms that can hold 2 people each. The goal is to rent the least number of rooms possible while making sure every room is fully occupied. I need to figure out how many large rooms they should rent.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the problem clearly. The total number of people is 26, and we need to split them into groups of 3 and 2, using as few rooms as possible. Each room must be fully occupied, so we can't have a partial room.\n\nI think the best way to approach this is by trying different combinations of large and small rooms and seeing which combination uses the fewest rooms. Since we want to minimize the number of rooms, we should try to maximize the number of people per room as much as possible.\n\nLet me denote the number of large rooms as L and the number of small rooms as S. The total number of people can be expressed as:\n\n3L + 2S = 26\n\nOur goal is to find non-negative integers L and S that satisfy this equation, and we want to minimize the total number of rooms, which is L + S.\n\nI can start by trying to solve for one variable in terms of the other. Let me solve for S in terms of L:\n\n2S = 26 - 3L  \nS = (26 - 3L) / 2\n\nSince S must be an integer, (26 - 3L) must be even. Let me check the possible values of L that make this true.\n\nLooking at 26 - 3L, since 3L must have the same parity as 26, which is even. Therefore, 3L must be even, which implies that L must be even because 3 is odd, and odd times even is even.\n\nSo, possible values of L are 0, 2, 4, etc., but since 3L cannot exceed 26, L can be 0, 2, or 4 (since 3*5=15, which would leave 11 people, which isn't divisible by 2).\n\nLet's try L = 0:\nS = (26 - 0)/2 = 13\nTotal rooms = 0 + 13 = 13\n\nL = 2:\nS = (26 - 6)/2 = 20/2 = 10\nTotal rooms = 2 + 10 = 12\n\nL = 4:\nS = (26 - 12)/2 = 14/2 = 7\nTotal rooms = 4 + 7 = 11\n\nWait, that seems better. Let me check if L can be higher.\n\nWait, 3L must be less than or equal to 26, so L can be up to 8 (since 3*8=24, leaving 2 people in small rooms). Let me check L=6:\n\nS = (26 - 18)/2 = 8/2 = 4\nTotal rooms = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nThat's better. Let's try L=8:\n\nS = (26 - 24)/2 = 2/2 = 1\nTotal rooms = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nThat's even better. Let me try L=10, but 3*10=30 which is more than 26, so that's not possible.\n\nWait, but I thought L=8 gives 9 rooms, which is the minimum. Let me confirm if that's correct.\n\nWait, let me check L=7:\n\n3*7=21, so S=(26-21)/2=5/2=2.5, which is not an integer, so that's invalid.\n\nSimilarly, L=5:\n\n3*5=15, S=(26-15)/2=11/2=5.5, not integer.\n\nL=3:\n\n3*3=9, S=(26-9)/2=17/2=8.5, not integer.\n\nL=1:\n\n3*1=3, S=(26-3)/2=23/2=11.5, not integer.\n\nSo, the possible valid combinations are:\n\n- L=0, S=13, total rooms=13\n- L=2, S=10, total rooms=12\n- L=4, S=7, total rooms=11\n- L=6, S=4, total rooms=10\n- L=8, S=1, total rooms=9\n\nOkay, so I have this problem where a tourist group has 26 people, and they want to rent rooms at a hotel. The rooms can hold either 3 people or 2 people each. The goal is to find out how many large rooms (which hold 3 people) they should rent so that every room is fully occupied and they use the least number of rooms possible.\n\nFirst, I need to set up an equation to represent this situation. Let me denote the number of large rooms as L and the number of small rooms as S. Each large room can hold 3 people, and each small room can hold 2 people. The total number of people is 26, so the equation would be:\n\n3L + 2S = 26\n\nMy goal is to find non-negative integers L and S that satisfy this equation, and I want to minimize the total number of rooms, which is L + S.\n\nTo solve this, I can try different values of L and see if S turns out to be an integer. Since the number of people must be exactly divisible by the room capacities, S must be an integer.\n\nLet me start with L=0:\n\nIf L=0, then 3*0 + 2S = 26  \nSo, 2S = 26  \nTherefore, S = 13\n\nTotal rooms = 0 + 13 = 13\n\nOkay, that's one possibility. Now, let's try L=1:\n\nIf L=1, then 3*1 + 2S = 26  \nSo, 2S = 23  \nTherefore, S = 11.5\n\nBut S must be an integer, so this is not possible.\n\nNext, L=2:\n\n3*2 + 2S = 26  \nSo, 2S = 20  \nTherefore, S = 10\n\nTotal rooms = 2 + 10 = 12\n\nThat's better. Let's continue with L=3:\n\n3*3 + 2S = 26  \nSo, 2S = 17  \nTherefore, S = 8.5\n\nNot an integer, so this doesn't work.\n\nL=4:\n\n3*4 + 2S = 26  \nSo, 2S = 14  \nTherefore, S = 7\n\nTotal rooms = 4 + 7 = 11\n\nEven better. Let's try L=5:\n\n3*5 + 2S = 26  \nSo, 2S = 11  \nTherefore, S = 5.5\n\nNot an integer, so invalid.\n\nL=6:\n\n3*6 + 2S = 26  \nSo, 2S = 8  \nTherefore, S = 4\n\nTotal rooms = 6 + 4 = 10\n\nGood. Now, L=7:\n\n3*7 + 2S = 26  \nSo, 2S = 5  \nTherefore, S = 2.5\n\nNot an integer, so invalid.\n\nL=8:\n\n3*8 + 2S = 26  \nSo, 2S = 2  \nTherefore, S = 1\n\nTotal rooms = 8 + 1 = 9\n\nEven better. Let me check if L=9:\n\n3*9 + 2S = 26  \nSo, 2S = -1\n\nNegative number of rooms doesn't make sense, so we can stop here.\n\nSo, the possible valid combinations are:\n\n- L=0, S=13, total rooms=13\n- L=2, S=10, total rooms=12\n- L=4, S=7, total rooms=11\n- L=6, S=4, total rooms=10\n- L=8, S=1, total rooms=9\n\nOut of these, the combination with the fewest rooms is L=8 and S=1, totaling 9 rooms.\n\nTherefore, the tourist group should rent 8 large rooms to minimize the number of rooms used while ensuring every room is fully occupied.\n</think>\n\nThe tourist group should rent 8 large rooms to minimize the number of rooms used while ensuring every room is fully occupied.\n\n\\boxed{8}","ground_truth":"8","predicted_answer":"8","is_correct":true,"was_retried":true}

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know there was a total of 1,050 milliliters (ml) of tea in the pot. Anna poured this tea into cups, and each cup had 65 ml of tea. I need to find out how much tea is left after she poured all the tea into the cups.\n\nHmm, so if each cup has 65 ml, I can find out how many cups Anna filled by dividing the total amount of tea by the amount per cup. That would be 1,050 ml divided by 65 ml per cup. Let me do that calculation: 1,050 ÷ 65. \n\nWait, 65 times 16 is 1,040, and 65 times 16.923 is approximately 1,050. But since we're dealing with milliliters, I should probably get an exact value. Let me use a calculator for this division: 1,050 ÷ 65 equals 16.1538... So, approximately 16.1538 cups can be filled. But since you can't have a fraction of a cup in practical terms, maybe I need to consider how many whole cups she can pour without any leftover tea. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just proceed with the exact division. So, 1,050 ÷ 65 equals 16.1538... cups. But since we're dealing with milliliters, maybe it's better to find out how much tea is left after pouring as many cups as possible without exceeding the total. \n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to find how much tea is poured into the cups and then subtract that from the total. If each cup is 65 ml and she pours into cups until there's no tea left, the amount poured would be the total number of cups multiplied by 65 ml. But since we don't know the number of cups, maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is just asking for the remaining tea after pouring as much as possible, which would be the remainder when 1,050 is divided by 65. So, 1,050 ÷ 65 equals 16 with a remainder. Let me calculate 65 times 16: 65 * 16 = 1,040. Then, subtracting that from 1,050 gives 10 ml. So, the remaining tea would be 10 ml.\n\nWait, but that seems too straightforward. Let me verify. If she pours 16 cups, that's 1,040 ml, leaving 10 ml. Alternatively, if she pours 17 cups, that would be 1,105 ml, which is more than the total tea available, so that's not possible.

That's 2 to the fourth power, so 16 = 2⁴.\n\nNow, to find the LCM, I need to take the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of these numbers. The primes here are just 2 and 3.\n\nLooking at the powers of 2: the highest power is 2⁴ from 16. For 3, the highest power is 3¹ from 6.\n\nSo, the LCM should be 2⁴ × 3¹. Let me calculate that.\n\n2⁴ is 16, and 3¹ is 3. Multiplying those together: 16 × 3 = 48.\n\nSo, the least common multiple of 6, 4, and 16 is 48. That means Hillary will do all three activities together again in 48 days.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If she swims every 6 days, in 48 days she'll swim 48 ÷ 6 = 8 times. She runs every 4 days, so 48 ÷ 4 = 12 times. And she cycles every 16 days, so 48 ÷ 16 = 3 times. Yeah, that all checks out. 48 is indeed a multiple of 6, 4, and 16, so it makes sense that it's the next day she does all three together.\n</think>\n\nThe next day Hillary will do all three activities together is in 48 days.\n\n\\boxed{48}","ground_truth":"48","predicted_answer":"48","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

The first and second bags have 11 apples in total, and the second and third bags have 18 apples in total. I need to find out how many apples are in the first and third bags combined.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Maybe I can use some equations to solve it. Let me assign variables to each bag:\n\n- Let A be the number of apples in the first bag.\n- Let B be the number of apples in the second bag.\n- Let C be the number of apples in the third bag.\n\nNow, I know that the total number of apples is 24, so:\n\nA + B + C = 24\n\nI also know that the first and second bags together have 11 apples:\n\nA + B = 11\n\nAnd the second and third bags together have 18 apples:\n\nB + C = 18\n\nI need to find A + C.\n\nLet me see how I can use these equations to find A + C.

If B is 5, then A = 11 - 5 = 6 and C = 18 - 5 = 13.\n\nLet me check if that adds up correctly.\n\nTotal apples: A + B + C = 6 + 5 + 13 = 24. That matches.\n\nFirst and second bags: 6 + 5 = 11. That matches.\n\nSecond and third bags: 5 + 13 = 18. That matches.\n\nSo, A + C = 6 + 13 = 19.\n\nWait, but I'm supposed to find A + C, which is 19.

Then, A = 11 - 5 = 6 and C = 18 - 5 = 13.\n\nTherefore, A + C = 6 + 13 = 19.\n\nOkay, that confirms it. So, the number of apples in the first and third bags together is 19.","full_output":"Okay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many apples are in the first and third bags together. Let me read the problem again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThere are three paper bags containing a total of 24 apples. The first and second bags together have 11 apples. The second and third bags together have 18 apples. I need to find out how many apples are in the first and third bags combined.\n\nHmm, let's break this down. Let me assign variables to each bag to make it easier. Let's say:\n\n- Let A be the number of apples in the first bag.\n- Let B be the number of apples in the second bag.\n- Let C be the number of apples in the third bag.\n\nNow, I have three pieces of information:\n\n1. The total number of apples in all three bags is 24. So, A + B + C = 24.\n2. The first and second bags together have 11 apples. So, A + B = 11.\n3. The second and third bags together have 18 apples. So, B + C = 18.\n\nI need to find A + C.\n\nLet me see how I can use these equations to find A + C.\n\nFirst, from equation 2, A + B = 11, so I can express A as A = 11 - B.\n\nFrom equation 3, B + C = 18, so I can express C as C = 18 - B.\n\nNow, if I substitute A and C in terms of B into equation 1:\n\nA + B + C = 24\n\n(11 - B) + B + (18 - B) = 24\n\nLet me simplify this step by step:\n\n11 - B + B + 18 - B = 24\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n11 + 18 - B = 24\n\n29 - B = 24\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\n29 - B = 24\n\nSubtract 24 from both sides:\n\n5 - B = 0\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right.

That matches.\n\nSo, A + C = 19.\n\nWait, but in my first calculation, I thought B was 5, which led to A + C being 19. Let me check if I did that correctly.\n\nWait, earlier I thought I made a mistake, but after rechecking, it seems correct. So, A + C is 19.\n\nBut let me try another approach to confirm.\n\nFrom equation 2: A + B = 11\n\nFrom equation 3: B + C = 18\n\nIf I subtract equation 2 from equation 3, I get:\n\n(B + C) - (A + B) = 18 - 11\n\nSimplify:\n\nC - A = 7\n\nSo, C = A + 7\n\nNow, from equation 1: A + B + C = 24\n\nSubstitute C:\n\nA + B + (A + 7) = 24\n\nSimplify:\n\n2A + B + 7 = 24\n\nSubtract 7 from both sides:\n\n2A + B = 17\n\nFrom equation 2: A + B = 11\n\nNow, subtract equation 2 from this new equation:\n\n(2A + B) - (A + B) = 17 -\n\nOkay, so I have this math problem here, and I need to figure out how many apples are in the first and third bags together.

The first and second bags have 11 apples in total, and the second and third bags have 18 apples in total.

Let me assign variables to each bag:\n\n- Let A be the number of apples in the first bag.\n- Let B be the number of apples in the second bag.\n- Let C be the number of apples in the third bag.\n\nNow, I know that the total number of apples is 24, so:\n\nA + B + C = 24\n\nI also know that the first and second bags together have 11 apples:\n\nA + B = 11\n\nAnd the second and third bags together have 18 apples:\n\nB + C = 18\n\nI need to find A + C.\n\nLet me see how I can use these equations to find A + C. Maybe I can express A and C in terms of B and then add them together.\n\nFrom the second equation, A + B = 11, I can solve for A:\n\nA = 11 - B\n\nFrom the third equation, B + C = 18, I can solve for C:\n\nC = 18 - B\n\nNow, if I substitute these expressions for A and C into the first equation, I can solve for B:\n\n(11 - B) + B + (18 - B) = 24\n\nLet me simplify this step by step:\n\n11 - B + B + 18 - B = 24\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n11 + 18 - B = 24\n\n29 - B = 24\n\nNow, solve for B:\n\n29 - B = 24\n\nSubtract 24 from both sides:\n\n5 - B = 0\n\nSo, B = 5\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. If B is 5, then A = 11 - 5 = 6 and C = 18 - 5 = 13.\n\nLet me check if that adds up correctly.\n\nTotal apples: A + B + C = 6 + 5 + 13 = 24. That matches.\n\nFirst and second bags: 6 + 5 = 11.

That seems right.\n\nBut let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe I can add the two equations involving A and C.\n\nFrom A + B = 11 and B + C = 18, if I add them together:\n\nA + B + B + C = 11 + 18\n\nSimplify:\n\nA + 2B + C = 29\n\nBut I know that A + B + C = 24, so subtracting that from the previous equation:\n\n(A + 2B + C) - (A + B + C) = 29 - 24\n\nSimplify:\n\nB = 5\n\nSo, B = 5. Then, A = 11 - 5 = 6 and C = 18 - 5 = 13.\n\nTherefore, A + C = 6 + 13 = 19.\n\nOkay, that confirms it.

Now, since Tara has $4 more than Megan, T = 11 + 4 = $15.\n\nTo double-check, Megan has $11, Tara has $15, so together they have $11 + $15 = $26, which matches the cost of the scooter. That makes sense.\n\nTherefore, the amount of money Tara had is $15.\n</think>\n\nTara had \\boxed{15} dollars.","ground_truth":"15","predicted_answer":"15","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Then he has football practice at 4:15 p.m. I need to find out how much time he had between the end of the test and the beginning of practice.\n\nFirst, let me figure out what time Kevin finished his test. He started at 2:34 p.m. and the test took 75 minutes. To add 75 minutes to 2:34 p.m., I can break it down. 60 minutes make an hour, so 75 minutes is 1 hour and 15 minutes. Adding 1 hour to 2:34 p.m. brings me to 3:34 p.m., and then adding the remaining 15 minutes gets me to 3:49 p.m.\n\nNow, football practice starts at 4:15 p.m., and Kevin finished his test at 3:49 p.m. To find the time between 3:49 p.m. and 4:15 p.m., I'll subtract 3:49 from 4:15. Since 4:15 is later than 3:49, I can subtract the minutes first: 15 minus 49. Hmm, that's not possible, so I'll borrow an hour. That makes 15 minus 49 become 15 + 60 minus 49, which is 26. Then subtract the hours: 4 minus 1 (since we borrowed an hour) is 3. So the time between the end of the test and practice is 3 hours and 26 minutes.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If Kevin finished at 3:49 and practice starts at 4:15, the difference is 4:15 minus 3:49. Subtracting the minutes: 15 minus 49, which is negative, so borrow an hour. So 15 + 60 = 75 minutes, minus 49 is 26 minutes. Subtracting the hours: 4 minus 1 (since we borrowed an hour) is 3. So yes, it's 3 hours and 26 minutes.","full_output":"Okay, so Kevin started his science test at 2:34 p.m. and finished it 75 minutes later.

I need to figure out how many containers she needs.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 30 and 48 because the GCD will tell me the largest number of cookies that can go into each container without any leftovers. The GCD is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.\n\nLet me list the factors of 30 and 48 to find their common divisors.\n\nFactors of 30: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30.\n\nFactors of 48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48.\n\nNow, the common factors are 1, 2, 3, and 6. The largest of these is 6, so the GCD is 6. That means each container can have 6 cookies, with an equal number of oatmeal and chocolate chip cookies.\n\nSince there are 30 oatmeal cookies, dividing them into containers with 6 each gives 30 / 6 = 5 containers.

Since we have 5 containers for oatmeal and 8 for chocolate chip, but each container must have both types, we need to find a number that works for both. That number would be the number of oatmeal containers, which is 5, because each container must have 6 oatmeal cookies, so 5 containers would hold 30 oatmeal cookies.

If each container has 6 oatmeal and 6 chocolate chip, then the number of containers is determined by the smaller number of each type. Oatmeal cookies require 5 containers, and chocolate chip require 8. The limiting factor is the oatmeal, so we can only have 5 containers because each needs 6 oatmeal cookies, totaling 30, which is exactly what we have. Therefore, we can't have more than 5 containers without running out of oatmeal cookies, even though we have enough chocolate chip cookies for 8 containers.\n\nSo, the final answer is 5 containers.","full_output":"Okay, so Kiara baked 30 oatmeal cookies and 48 chocolate chip cookies.

{"id":1102,"question":"By coincidence, Monica's Obedience School trained the same number of dogs and cats last week. The school teaches dogs in groups of 18 and cats in groups of 3. What is the smallest number of cats the school could have had?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so Monica's Obedience School trained the same number of dogs and cats last week. They teach dogs in groups of 18 and cats in groups of 3. We need to find the smallest number of cats the school could have had.\n\nFirst, let's break down the problem. The school has two groups: dogs and cats, with the same number of each. Dogs are taught in groups of 18, and cats are taught in groups of 3. So, the total number of dogs and cats must be multiples of both 18 and 3.\n\nWait, but 18 is already a multiple of 3 because 18 divided by 3 is 6. So, if the school has a certain number of dogs and cats, both numbers need to be multiples of 18 because they have to be equal and each group size divides evenly into the total count.\n\nTo find the smallest number of cats, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 18 and 3. Since 18 is a multiple of 3, the LCM of 18 and 3 is just 18. That means the smallest number of cats the school could have is 18.\n\nWait, hold on. Let me make sure I'm understanding this correctly. The school has the same number of dogs and cats, and both numbers need to be divisible by 18 and 3 respectively. So, if there are C cats, then the number of dogs is also C. The number of dog groups would be C divided by 18, and the number of cat groups would be C divided by 3.\n\nFor both C divided by 18 and C divided by 3 to be whole numbers, C must be a multiple of both 18 and 3. The smallest such number is 18, so the smallest number of cats is 18.\n\nWait, that seems a bit low. Let me think again. If there are 18 cats, then the number of dog groups is 18 divided by 18, which is 1. That's fine. The number of cat groups is 18 divided by 3, which is 6. That's also fine. So yes, 18 is the smallest number of cats possible.\n\nBut maybe I should double-check. Let's say there are 18 cats. Then the number of dog groups is 18 / 18 = 1, and the number of cat groups is 18 / 3 = 6. Both are whole numbers, so 18 is valid. If we tried a smaller number, like 9, then 9 / 18 is 0.5, which isn't a whole number, so that wouldn't work. Similarly, 6 / 18 is 0.333, which isn't a whole number. So 18 is indeed the smallest.\n\nWait, but 18 is the number of cats, not the number of dog groups. So the smallest number of cats is 18.\n\nWait, no.

So, Gabe and Steven both walk the same total number of pets, but Gabe does it in groups of 2, and Steven does it in groups of 10. I need to find the smallest number of pets they could each be walking so that both groups add up to the same total.\n\nFirst, I'll think about what it means for them to walk the same total number of pets. That means the total number of pets Gabe walks (let's call that number G) must equal the total number Steven walks (let's call that number S). \n\nGabe walks in groups of 2, so the total number of pets he walks would be 2 multiplied by the number of groups he walks. Similarly, Steven walks in groups of 10, so his total would be 10 multiplied by the number of groups he walks. \n\nSince their totals are equal, we can set up an equation: 2G = 10S.

How many Lemon Heads does she have left?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem step by step. The problem is: \"Lemon heads come in packages of 5. Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the problem is asking. It’s about lemon heads that come in packs of 5, and Ann ate 78 of them. I need to find out how many lemon heads she has left. \n\nSo, the key information here is:\n- Each package contains 5 lemon heads.\n- Ann ate a total of 78 lemon heads.\n\nI think the first step is to figure out how many full packages Ann ate. Since each package has 5 lemon heads, I can divide the number of lemon heads she ate by the number in each package. \n\nLet me write that down:\nNumber of full packages = Total lemon heads eaten / Lemon heads per package\nNumber of full packages = 78 / 5\n\nNow, let me do that division:\n78 divided by 5 is 15 with a remainder of 3. So, Ann ate 15 full packages and had 3 lemon heads left from another package.\n\nBut the question is asking for the number of lemon heads Ann has left, not the number of full packages. So, I need to consider the remaining lemon heads.\n\nSince each package has 5 lemon heads, and she had 3 left, that means she has 3 lemon heads remaining. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure I'm interpreting this correctly. The problem doesn't specify how many lemon heads she had initially, only that she ate 78. So, I can't determine the exact number of lemon heads she had before eating 78.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. If each package has 5 lemon heads, and she ate 78, the number of lemon heads left would be 78 minus the number she ate. But without knowing how many packages she ate, I can't find the exact number left.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume she ate exactly 15 full packages, that would be 75 lemon heads, and then she had 3 left. But that's assuming she didn't eat any partial packages.\n\nWait, the problem doesn't specify whether she ate only full packages or some were partially eaten. So, without that information, I can't be certain.\n\nI think the safest approach is to assume that she ate only full packages. So, 15 packages, 75 lemon heads, and 3 left.\n\nTherefore, the number of lemon heads she has left is 3.","full_output":"Okay, so Ann has some Lemon Heads in packages of 5. She ate 78 of them, and we need to find out how many she has left. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that Lemon Heads come in packages of 5. That means each package has 5 Lemon Heads. Ann ate 78, so we need to find out how many packages she ate from and how many Lemon Heads are left in total.\n\nWait, maybe I should figure out how many packages she ate. If each package has 5 Lemon Heads, then the number of packages she ate would be 78 divided by 5. Let me calculate that: 78 divided by 5 is 15 with a remainder of 3. So, she ate 15 full packages and had 3 Lemon Heads left from another package.\n\nBut since each package has 5 Lemon Heads, the total number of Lemon Heads she ate is 15 packages * 5 Lemon Heads/package = 75 Lemon Heads. Adding the remaining 3, she ate a total of 78 Lemon Heads, which matches the given information.\n\nNow, to find out how many Lemon Heads she has left, we need to know the total number she originally had minus the 78 she ate. However, the question doesn't specify how many Lemon Heads were in the original package. It just says Lemon Heads come in packages of 5, and Ann ate 78.\n\nWait, maybe I misunderstood. Is the total number of Lemon Heads Ann had initially also in packages of 5? Or is there a different way to calculate the remaining Lemon Heads?\n\nActually, the problem doesn't specify the total number of Lemon Heads Ann had initially. It just tells us she ate 78 and we need to find how many are left. Since the packages are in multiples of 5, and she ate 78, which is 15 packages and 3 Lemon Heads, the remaining Lemon Heads would be the leftovers from the packages she didn't eat from.\n\nBut without knowing the original number, I can't calculate the exact number left. Maybe the question expects an expression or another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is asking how many full packages she has left, but that's not what's stated. It says she has how many Lemon Heads left, so I think it's expecting a numerical answer.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again: \"Lemon heads come in packages of 5. Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?\"\n\nOh, I see. It doesn't specify the original number of Lemon Heads, so maybe the answer is expressed in terms of packages. But the question asks for the number of Lemon Heads, not the number of packages.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to assume that Ann had a certain number of Lemon Heads initially, but since it's not given, I might need to consider that she could have had any multiple of 5 plus 78.\n\nWait, no, that doesn't make sense. The question is straightforward: Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads, which came in packages of 5. How many are left? It's asking for the remaining Lemon Heads, so the answer would depend on the initial number she had. But since the initial number isn't provided, maybe the answer is expressed as the remaining number after subtracting 78, but that doesn't give a specific value.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The problem might be expecting an expression or maybe the answer is zero if she ate exactly 78, but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, maybe the answer is simply 78, but that's not about leftovers.\n\nWait, I think I need to re-express the problem. Let me try to model it mathematically. Let’s denote the number of packages Ann ate as P. Each package has 5 Lemon Heads, so she ate 5P Lemon Heads. She ate 78, so 5P = 78. To find P, divide both sides by 5: P = 78 / 5 = 15.6. But she can't eat a fraction of a package, so she ate 15 full packages and had 3 left from another.\n\nBut the question is asking how many Lemon Heads she has left, not how many packages. Since each package has 5, the remaining 3 Lemon Heads would be 3, but that doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a package. Maybe the question is expecting the number of full packages she has left, but that's not specified.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simply asking for the number of Lemon Heads she has left, not considering the packages. Since she ate 78, the remaining would be the initial number minus 78. But without the initial number, I can't calculate it numerically.\n\nWait, maybe the question is\n\nOkay, let's tackle this step by step. So, the problem is: \"Lemon heads come in packages of 5. Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?\"\n\nHmm, okay, first, I know that Lemon heads are sold in packs of 5. So, each pack has 5 Lemon heads. Ann ate 78 of them, and we need to find out how many are left.\n\nAlright, let me think about this. If each pack has 5 Lemon heads, then the number of packs Ann ate would be the total she ate divided by 5. So, 78 divided by 5. Let me calculate that: 78 divided by 5 is 15 with a remainder of 3. So, she ate 15 full packs and had 3 Lemon heads left from another pack.\n\nBut wait, the question is asking for the number of Lemon heads she has left, not the number of full packs. So, since she ate 78 Lemon heads, which is 15 packs plus 3 individual Lemon heads, the number of Lemon heads she has left would be the total she had initially minus 78.\n\nBut the problem doesn't specify how many Lemon heads she had initially. It only tells us that she ate 78. So, we can't determine the exact number of Lemon heads left without knowing the initial count.\n\nWait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me try a different approach. Maybe the question is just asking for the remaining Lemon heads after she ate 78, assuming she had a certain number. But since that number isn't given, I can't compute the exact value.\n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is simply the remaining Lemon heads, which would be the initial number minus 78. But without knowing the initial number, I can't provide a numerical answer.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. Let me check again. It says, \"Lemon heads come in packages of 5. Ann ate 78 Lemon Heads. How many Lemon Heads does she have left?\" So, it's just a straightforward subtraction problem.\n\nIf she ate 78 Lemon heads, and they come in packages of 5, then the number of full packages she ate is 78 divided by 5, which is 15 with a remainder of 3. So, she ate 15 full packages and had 3 left from another. But the question is asking for the number of Lemon heads left, not the number of full packages.\n\nTherefore, the remaining Lemon heads would be the total she had initially minus 78. However, since we don't know the initial number, we can't determine the exact value. It seems like the problem is missing some information.\n\nWait, maybe the question is expecting an expression or a way to calculate it. If I denote the initial number of Lemon heads as L, then the remaining Lemon heads would be L - 78. But without knowing L, I can't provide a specific number.\n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is simply that we need more information to determine the exact number of Lemon heads left. But the problem seems to suggest that it's possible to find an answer, so maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me try to think differently. Maybe the question is implying that the initial number was a multiple of 5, so she had, say, 50 Lemon heads. Then, she ate 78, but that doesn't make sense because she can't eat more than she has. So, perhaps the initial number was more than 78, and we need to find out how many are left after she ate 78.\n\nBut again, without knowing the initial number, I can't compute the exact remaining Lemon heads. It seems like there's not enough information to solve this problem as it stands.\n\nMaybe the question is expecting a different approach. Let's see: if each package has 5 Lemon heads, and she ate 78, then the number of packages she ate is 78 divided by 5, which is 15 with a remainder of 3. So, she ate 15 full packages and had 3 left. But the question is about the total remaining, so it's 3 Lemon heads.\n\nWait, that seems too simplistic. Maybe the question is just asking for the remaining after eating 78, regardless of the initial count. But without knowing the initial count, I can't give a specific number.\n\nHmm, perhaps the answer is simply 0 if she ate exactly 78, but that doesn't make sense because she can't have negative Lemon heads. So, maybe the answer is that she has 3 Lemon heads left because she ate 15 full packages and had 3 left.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many she has left, so it's expecting a numerical answer. Since we don't know the initial count, I think the answer is that she\n\nOkay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem step by step. The problem is: \"Lemon heads come in packages of 5.

The Sweettarts come in packages of 7, but I don't think the number of packages affects the problem directly because the question is only about the total number eaten and left. \n\nSo, Stephen ate 64 Sweettarts, and each package has 7. To find out how many packages he ate from, I can divide 64 by 7. Let me do that calculation: 64 divided by 7 is 9 with a remainder of 1, because 7 times 9 is 63, and 64 minus 63 is 1. \n\nThat means Stephen ate 9 full packages and 1 extra Sweet tart.

Jawbreakers are sold in packages that contain 8 pieces each. Sarah bought a certain number of these packages and ate 20 of them. We need to find out how many Jawbreakers she has left.\n\nFirst, I need to determine how many packages Sarah bought. Since each package contains 8 Jawbreakers and she ate 20, I can divide the number of eaten Jawbreakers by the number in each package to find the number of packages she consumed.\n\nSo, 20 divided by 8 equals 2.5.

However, since the question doesn't specify whether she ate a full package or not, I'll proceed with the calculation as is.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the total number of Jawbreakers Sarah ate by multiplying the number of packages she consumed by the number of Jawbreakers per package.

So, if I let the original number of apples on the tree be \\( x \\), then after picking five, the number of apples left would be \\( x - 5 \\). \n\nBut wait, the problem says that after picking, there are six apples left.

{"id":1203,"question":"John was given $14.00 in order to buy a gift. This covered half of the cost. How much did the gift cost?","chain_of_thought":"Alright, so John was given $14.00 to buy a gift, and that $14.00 covered half of the cost. Hmm, okay, so if $14.00 is half, then the total cost must be double that. Let me think about that step by step. \n\nFirst, I know that if something is half of something else, then the full amount is twice the given amount. So, if half the cost is $14.00, then the total cost should be 14 times 2. That makes sense because if half is 14, adding another 14 would give the full amount. \n\nLet me write that down to visualize it better. Let’s denote the total cost as C. According to the problem, half of C is $14.00. So, mathematically, that can be written as (1/2) * C = 14.00. To find C, I can multiply both sides of the equation by 2. That gives C = 14.00 * 2. \n\nCalculating that, 14.00 multiplied by 2 is 28.00. So, the total cost of the gift is $28.00. To make sure I did this right, I can check it by halving $28.00, which should give me back $14.00, matching the amount John was given. \n\nYes, that seems correct.

I know that 15 times 12 is 180 because 15 times 10 is 150, and 15 times 2 is 30, so 150 + 30 equals 180. Therefore, 15 goes into 180 exactly 12 times.\n\nSo, the calculation is:\n\n180 ÷ 15 = 12\n\nThat means I can buy 12 ink cartridges with $180.\n\nLet me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If each cartridge is $15 and I have 12 of them, then 12 times 15 should equal 180. Let me verify:\n\n12 × 15 = 180\n\nYes, that's correct. So, I can confidently say that with $180, I can buy 12 ink cartridges.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{12}","ground_truth":"12","predicted_answer":"12","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

We need to find the present ages of all three.\n\nLet's denote the present ages as follows:\n- Let \\( S_1 \\) be the age of the younger son.\n- Let \\( S_2 \\) be the age of the older son.\n- Let \\( F \\) be the father's present age.\n\nFrom the problem, we know that \\( S_2 = S_1 + 2 \\) because one son is two years older than the other.\n\nTen years ago, their ages would have been:\n- Younger son: \\( S_1 - 10 \\)\n- Older son: \\( S_2 - 10 \\)\n- Father: \\( F - 10 \\)\n\nAccording to the problem, the sum of the sons' ages ten years ago was one-third of the father's age at that time:\n\\[ (S_1 - 10) + (S_2 - 10) = \\frac{1}{3}(F - 10) \\]\n\nSimplifying the left side:\n\\[ S_1 + S_2 - 20 = \\frac{1}{3}(F - 10) \\]\n\nWe also know that the sum of the sons' present ages is 14 years less than the father's present age:\n\\[ S_1 + S_2 = F - 14 \\]\n\nNow, let's substitute \\( S_2 = S_1 + 2 \\) into the equations.\n\nFirst, substitute \\( S_2 \\) in the first equation:\n\\[ S_1 + (S_1 + 2) - 20 = \\frac{1}{3}(F - 10) \\]\n\\[ 2S_1 + 2 - 20 = \\frac{1}{3}(F - 10) \\]\n\\[ 2S_1 - 18 = \\frac{1}{3}(F - 10) \\]\nMultiply both sides by 3:\n\\[ 6S_1 - 54 = F - 10 \\]\n\\[ F = 6S_1 - 54 + 10 \\]\n\\[ F = 6S_1 - 44 \\]\n\nNow, substitute \\( S_2 = S_1 + 2 \\) into the second equation:\n\\[ S_1 + (S_1 + 2) = F - 14 \\]\n\\[ 2S_1 + 2 = F - 14 \\]\nSubstitute \\( F \\) from the previous equation:\n\\[ 2S_1 + 2 = (6S_1 - 44) - 14 \\]\n\\[ 2S_1 + 2 = 6S_1 - 58 \\]\nSubtract \\( 2S_1 \\) from both sides:\n\\[ 2 = 4S_1 - 58 \\]\nAdd 58 to both sides:\n\\[ 60 = 4S_1 \\]\nDivide by 4:\n\\[ S_1 = 15 \\]\n\nNow, find \\( S_2 \\):\n\\[ S_2 = S_1 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17 \\]\n\nFinally, find \\( F \\):\n\\[ F = 6S_1 - 44 = 6 * 15 - 44 = 90 - 44 = 46 \\]\n\nSo, the present ages are:\n- Younger son: 15 years\n- Older son: 17 years\n- Father: 46 years\n</think>\n\nThe present ages are:\n- Younger son: 15 years\n- Older son: 17 years\n- Father: 46 years\n\n\\boxed{15}, \\boxed{17}, \\boxed{46}","ground_truth":"21","predicted_answer":"46","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

{"id":1249,"question":"A two digit number is four times the sum of its digits and twice the product of the digits. Find the number.","full_output":"Okay, so I need to solve this math problem: \"A two-digit number is four times the sum of its digits and twice the product of the digits. Find the number.\"\n\nAlright, let's break this down. First, I'll represent the two-digit number in terms of its digits. Let's say the tens digit is 'a' and the units digit is 'b'. So, the number can be written as 10a + b.\n\nAccording to the problem, this number is four times the sum of its digits. So, 10a + b = 4*(a + b). That gives me one equation.\n\nSimilarly, the number is twice the product of its digits, so 10a + b = 2*(a*b). That's the second equation.\n\nNow, I can set these two expressions equal to each other since they both equal the number:\n\n4*(a + b) = 2*(a*b)\n\nLet me simplify this equation. Dividing both sides by 2 gives me:\n\n2*(a + b) = a*b\n\nExpanding the left side:\n\n2a + 2b = a*b\n\nNow, I'll rearrange the terms to get all terms on one side:\n\na*b - 2a - 2b = 0\n\nHmm, this looks like it can be factored. Let me try adding 4 to both sides to make it factorable:\n\na*b - 2a - 2b + 4 = 4\n\nNow, I can factor the left side:\n\n(a - 2)*(b - 2) = 4\n\nOkay, so (a - 2)*(b - 2) equals 4. Since a and b are digits, they must be integers between 0 and 9 (with a being at least 1 because it's a two-digit number).\n\nNow, I'll list the pairs of integers that multiply to 4:\n\n1. (1, 4)\n2. (2, 2)\n3. (4, 1)\n\nThese are the positive integer pairs.

What is the newspaper ad's perimeter?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I have this problem where each side of a square newspaper ad is 8 centimeters long, and I need to find the perimeter of the ad. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that a square has four equal sides. That means all four sides are the same length. In this case, each side is 8 centimeters. Now, perimeter is the total length around the shape, right? So for a square, it's just the sum of all four sides.\n\nLet me write this down to visualize it better. If each side is 8 cm, then the perimeter would be 8 cm + 8 cm + 8 cm + 8 cm. That's adding up all four sides. Alternatively, since all sides are equal, I can multiply the length of one side by 4 to get the perimeter.\n\nSo, 8 cm multiplied by 4 should give me the total perimeter.

{"id":1305,"question":"At the carnival, nine friends bought eight hundred sixty-five tickets. If they wanted to split all the tickets so each friend got the same amount, how many more tickets would they need to buy?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, there are nine friends who bought a total of eight hundred sixty-five tickets at the carnival. They want to split these tickets equally, but if they do that, each friend would get the same number of tickets. The question is asking how many more tickets they need to buy so that when they split them equally, each friend gets the same whole number of tickets. Hmm, that means we need to find the next multiple of nine after eight hundred sixty-five because nine friends can't split a ticket; they need whole tickets.\n\nFirst, I think I need to divide eight hundred sixty-five by nine to see how many tickets each friend would get and if there's a remainder. If there's a remainder, that means they need to buy more tickets to make the total number of tickets divisible by nine. Let me do the division: 865 divided by 9.\n\nLet me calculate that. 9 times 96 is 864, which is just one less than 865. So, 9 times 96 equals 864, and 865 minus 864 is 1. That means if they have 865 tickets, when they divide by 9, each friend would get 96 tickets, and there would be 1 ticket left over. Since they can't split a ticket, they need to buy enough tickets to make the total divisible by nine. The next multiple of nine after 865 is 870 because 9 times 96 is 864, and 864 plus 6 is 870. So, they need 870 - 865 = 5 more tickets.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If they buy 5 more tickets, the total becomes 865 + 5 = 870. Dividing 870 by 9 gives 96 with no remainder because 9 times 96 is 864, and 870 minus 864 is 6, but 9 times 96 is still 864, so 870 divided by 9 is 96.666... Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, 9 times 96 is 864, and 870 is 6 more than 864. So, 870 divided by 9 is 96 with a remainder of 6, which means they actually have 6 tickets left over. That doesn't make sense because if you have 870 tickets, each friend would get 96 and 2/3 tickets, which isn't practical. So, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find the remainder when 865 is divided by 9 and then determine how many more tickets are needed to reach the next multiple of 9. So, 865 divided by 9 is 96 with a remainder of 1, as I found earlier. That means they need 96 + 1 = 97 friends to have 97 tickets, but they only have 9 friends. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I'm confusing the number of friends with the number of tickets. Let me try again. They have 865 tickets and 9 friends. If they want to split the tickets equally, each friend should get 865 divided by 9, which is approximately 96.111 tickets. Since they can't split tickets, they need to round up to 97 tickets per friend. So, the total number of tickets needed would be 97 multiplied by 9, which is 873. They currently have 865, so they need to buy 873 minus 865, which is 8 more tickets.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Let me confirm that. If they have 865 tickets and need to have 97 per friend, then total needed is 97 * 9 = 873. 873 - 865 = 8. So, they need to buy 8 more tickets. But let me check if that's correct. 865 + 8 = 873, and 873 divided by 9 is exactly 97, so each friend gets 97 tickets. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of it as the remainder when 865 is divided by 9 is 1, so they need 9 - 1 = 8 more tickets to make it divisible by 9. Yeah, that matches my earlier calculation. So, the answer is 8 tickets.","full_output":"Okay, let me try to figure out how to solve this problem. So, there are nine friends who bought a total of eight hundred sixty-five tickets at the carnival. They want to split these tickets equally, but if they do that, each friend would get the same number of tickets. The question is asking how many more tickets they need to buy so that when they split them equally, each friend gets the same whole number of tickets. Hmm, that means we need to find the next multiple of nine after eight hundred sixty-five because nine friends can't split a ticket; they need whole tickets.\n\nFirst, I think I need to divide eight hundred sixty-five by nine to see how many tickets each friend would get and if there's a remainder. If there's a remainder, that means they need to buy more tickets to make the total number of tickets divisible by nine. Let me do the division: 865 divided by 9.\n\nLet me calculate that. 9 times 96 is 864, which is just one less than 865. So, 9 times 96 equals 864, and 865 minus 864 is 1. That means if they have 865 tickets, when they divide by 9, each friend would get 96 tickets, and there would be 1 ticket left over. Since they can't split a ticket, they need to buy enough tickets to make the total divisible by nine. The next multiple of nine after 865 is 870 because 9 times 96 is 864, and 864 plus 6 is 870. So, they need 870 - 865 = 5 more tickets.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If they buy 5 more tickets, the total becomes 865 + 5 = 870. Dividing 870 by 9 gives 96 with no remainder because 9 times 96 is 864, and 870 minus 864 is 6, but 9 times 96 is still 864, so 870 divided by 9 is 96.666... Wait, that can't be right. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nWait, 9 times 96 is 864, and 870 is 6 more than 864. So, 870 divided by 9 is 96 with a remainder of 6, which means they actually have 6 tickets left over. That doesn't make sense because if you have 870 tickets, each friend would get 96 and 2/3 tickets, which isn't practical. So, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should find the remainder when 865 is divided by 9 and then determine how many more tickets are needed to reach the next multiple of 9. So, 865 divided by 9 is 96 with a remainder of 1, as I found earlier. That means they need 96 + 1 = 97 friends to have 97 tickets, but they only have 9 friends. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nI think I'm confusing the number of friends with the number of tickets. Let me try again. They have 865 tickets and 9 friends. If they want to split the tickets equally, each friend should get 865 divided by 9, which is approximately 96.111 tickets. Since they can't split tickets, they need to round up to 97 tickets per friend. So, the total number of tickets needed would be 97 multiplied by 9, which is 873. They currently have 865, so they need to buy 873 minus 865, which is 8 more tickets.\n\nWait, that makes more sense. Let me confirm that. If they have 865 tickets and need to have 97 per friend, then total needed is 97 * 9 = 873. 873 - 865 = 8. So, they need to buy 8 more tickets. But let me check if that's correct. 865 + 8 = 873, and 873 divided by 9 is exactly 97, so each friend gets 97 tickets. That seems right.\n\nAlternatively, if I think of it as the remainder when 865 is divided by 9 is 1, so they need 9 - 1 = 8 more tickets to make it divisible by 9.

So, 650 divided by 3. Let me calculate that: 3 goes into 650 how many times? Well, 3 times 200 is 600, so that leaves a remainder of 50. Then, 3 goes into 50 sixteen times because 3 times 16 is 48, leaving a remainder of 2. So, 650 divided by 3 is 216 with a remainder of 2.

To find out how many flowers each bouquet will have, I should divide the total number of flowers by the number of bouquets.\n\nSo, 601 divided by 8.

Let me start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe store has 999 movies on five shelves. The owner wants each shelf to have the same number of movies. So, I think I need to divide the total number of movies by the number of shelves to find out how many movies each shelf should have, and then see if there's any remainder. If there is a remainder, that means some shelves won't be completely full, and the owner will need to add more movies to those shelves to make them equal.\n\nFirst, I'll divide 999 by 5. Let me do that calculation. 5 goes into 999 how many times? 5 times 199 is 995, and that leaves a remainder of 4 because 999 minus 995 is 4. So, each shelf can have 199 movies, and there will be 4 movies left over.\n\nSince the owner wants each shelf to have the same number, those 4 extra movies can't be evenly distributed without making some shelves have more. Therefore, the owner will need to add 4 more movies to reach 200 on those shelves.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I add 4 movies, the total becomes 999 + 4 = 1003. Now, dividing 1003 by 5 gives exactly 200.6, which doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a movie. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in my initial division.\n\nLet me try again. 5 times 199 is 995, as I had before, but 995 + 4 is 1000. So, if I add 4 movies, the total becomes 1000, which is divisible by 5. That means each shelf can have exactly 200 movies. So, the owner needs to add 4 more movies.\n\nWait, but the problem says there are 999 movies. If I add 4, it becomes 1003, which isn't divisible by 5. Maybe I should think differently. Perhaps the owner wants to distribute the movies as evenly as possible, but the question is asking how many more movies are needed to make each shelf equal.\n\nSo, since 999 divided by 5 is 199 with a remainder of 4, the owner needs to add 1 more movie to 4 shelves to make them each have 200. But the question is asking how many more movies he would need in total. So, adding 1 to 4 shelves would require adding 4 more movies. Therefore, the owner needs to add 4 more movies to reach a total of 1003, which can then be divided equally.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the question is about how many more movies are needed beyond the current count. So, if he has 999 and wants to make each shelf have 200, which is 5 more than 199, but 199*5=995, so he needs 4 more to reach 999+4=1003, which is 5*200=1000, but that's not exact. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me think differently. If he has 999 movies and 5 shelves, and he wants each shelf to have the same number, the number of movies per shelf should be the ceiling of 999 divided by 5. That is, 999/5=199.8, so the ceiling is 200. Therefore, each shelf should have 200 movies, which requires a total of 5*200=1000 movies. Since he only has 999, he needs 1 more movie to make it 1000. So, he needs 1 more movie to make each shelf have 200.\n\nWait, but the question is asking how many more movies he would need, not the total. So, if he needs 1000 in total and he has 999, he needs 1 more. Therefore, he needs 1 more movie.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought he needed to add 4 movies. Which is correct? Let me check.\n\nIf he divides 999 by 5, it's 199 with a remainder of 4. So, he can put 199 on each shelf, totaling 995, and then he has 4 movies left.

I need to figure out how many tables are required to accommodate all 287 guests.\n\nFirst, I'll start by understanding the numbers involved. We have 287 people in total, and each table can seat 9 people.

So, 71 times 4 is 284, which is 1 more than 283, meaning that 71 goes into 283 a little less than 4 times. \n\nTo get a more precise value, I can calculate:\n\n\\[ n = 4 - \\frac{1}{71} \\approx 4 - 0.014 = 3.986 \\]\n\nSince the number of rounds must be a whole number, we'll need to round this to the nearest whole number.

I need to figure out how many shelves they would need. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each shelf can hold 84 video games. So, to find out how many shelves are needed, I should divide the total number of video games by the number of games per shelf. That makes sense because division tells me how many groups of a certain size I can have from a total.\n\nSo, the total number of video games is 163, and each shelf holds 84 games. I can set up the division like this: 163 ÷ 84. Let me do that calculation. \n\nWhen I divide 163 by 84, I'm essentially asking how many times 84 fits into 163. Let me see, 84 times 1 is 84, and 84 times 2 is 168. Oh, but 168 is more than 163, so 84 can't fit into 163 two full times. That means 1 shelf isn't enough because 84 is less than 163.

I need to see how many shelves are required to hold all 163 games.\n\nLet me try dividing 163 by 84. 84 goes into 163 once with a remainder. To find the exact number of shelves, I need to consider how many full shelves can be filled and if there's any leftover space.\n\nCalculating 163 ÷ 84, I can set it up as:\n\n84 ) 163.000\n\n84 goes into 163 once (1 * 84 = 84).

Since 840 is more than 790, I'll use 9 times. 84 * 9 = 756. Subtract 756 from 790, and I get 34.\n\nSo, after the first division, I have 1 with a remainder of 79, then 9 with a remainder of 34. I can continue this process, but since the remainder is less than the divisor, I can stop here.\n\nSo, the total number of shelves needed is 1 (for the first division) plus 9 (for the second division), which equals 10. But wait, that doesn't seem right because 84 * 10 = 840, which is way more than 163. I must have made a mistake in my calculation.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Maybe I should use multiplication to find how many shelves are needed. If each shelf holds 84 games, how many shelves are needed to hold 163 games?\n\nSo, 84 * x = 163, where x is the number of shelves. Solving for x, x = 163 / 84. Calculating this, x ≈ 1.93.

The problem says the ratio of games he won to games he lost was 3:2, and he won 18 games.

Let me denote the number of games he lost as L.\n\nSo, the ratio can be written as 3 (wins) : 2 (losses). This means 3/2 = 18/L. To find L, I can cross-multiply: 3L = 2 * 18.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that at each stop, he drops off nine boxes. He already made some stops, but the problem doesn't specify how many he had already made. It just says he has to make three more stops. Hmm, maybe I need to assume he made some stops before and then adds three more.

{"id":1565,"question":"John threw a Halloween party where 13 people showed up.

The question is asking how many people didn't wear costumes. \n\nLet me break this down. The total number of people who attended the party is 13. Out of these, 6 people are wearing costumes. To find out how many didn't wear costumes, I need to subtract the number of people who did wear costumes from the total number of attendees.\n\nSo, the calculation would be:\nTotal attendees - People who wore costumes = People who didn't wear costumes\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n13 (total attendees) - 6 (people who wore costumes) = 7 (people who didn't wear costumes)\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. If 6 people wore costumes, then the number of people who didn't wear would be 13 minus 6, which is 7. But I want to make sure I'm doing this correctly.\n\nLet me visualize it. Imagine there are 13 people at the party. 6 of them are wearing Halloween masks. So, each person is either wearing a mask or not. If I take away the 6 who are wearing masks, the remaining people must be those who didn't wear masks.\n\nSo, 13 minus 6 equals 7. That means 7 people didn't wear Halloween costumes.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If 6 people are wearing costumes, then the number of people not wearing is 13 minus 6, which is indeed 7. So, the answer should be 7 people didn't wear costumes.\n\nBut just to be sure, let me count it out. If I have 13 people, and 6 are wearing, then:\n\n1st person: wears\n2nd person: wears\n3rd person: wears\n4th person: doesn't wear\n5th person: doesn't wear\n6th person: doesn't wear\n7th person: doesn't wear\n8th person: doesn't wear\n9th person: doesn't wear\n10th person: doesn't wear\n11th person: doesn't wear\n12th person: doesn't wear\n13th person: doesn't wear\n\nSo, from 4th to 13th, that's 10 people not wearing.

So, the problem says that a pet store took ten birds out of a cage and still had nine left inside. The question is asking how many birds were in the cage at the beginning.\n\nHmm, okay. Let's break this down. If the pet store took ten birds out, that means those ten birds are no longer in the cage. So, the number of birds that are still inside the cage would be the total number of birds minus the ten that were taken out.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that there are nine birds left inside after taking out ten. So, if I let the total number of birds initially in the cage be X, then after taking out ten, the remaining birds would be X - 10. According to the problem, this remaining number is nine.

That's six different types of pizzas.\n\nOkay, so I need to add all these numbers together. Let's start with 92 pepperoni. Adding 106 sausage gives me 92 + 106 = 198. Next, adding cheese: 198 + 96 = 294. Then, adding mushroom: 294 + 104 = 400. After that, anchovies: 400 + 96 = 496.

Hmm, 6 goes into 58 nine times (6*9=54), leaving a remainder of 4. Bring down the 4 to make 44. 6 goes into 44 seven times (6*7=42), leaving a remainder of 2. Bring down the 0 to make 20. 6 goes into 20 three times (6*3=18), leaving a remainder of 2.

So, first, I know that the mean is the average, which means I need to add up all the pizzas sold and then divide by the number of different pizza types.\n\nLet me list out the numbers again to make sure I have them right: 92 pepperoni, 106 sausage, 96 cheese, 104 mushroom, 96 anchovies, and 88 pineapple. That's six different types of pizzas.\n\nOkay, so I need to add all these numbers together. Let's start with 92 pepperoni. Adding 106 sausage gives me 92 + 106 = 198. Next, adding cheese: 198 + 96 = 294. Then, adding mushroom: 294 + 104 = 400. After that, anchovies: 400 + 96 = 496. Finally, adding pineapple: 496 + 88 = 584.\n\nSo, the total number of pizzas sold is 584. Now, since there are six different types of pizzas, I need to divide this total by 6 to find the mean. \n\nLet me do the division: 584 ÷ 6. Hmm, 6 goes into 58 nine times (6*9=54), leaving a remainder of 4. Bring down the 4 to make 44. 6 goes into 44 seven times (6*7=42), leaving a remainder of 2. Bring down the 0 to make 20. 6 goes into 20 three times (6*3=18), leaving a remainder of 2.

If both shipped 'x' packages, then Sarah's total packages would be 18 times x, and Ryan's would be 11 times x. But wait, actually, I think I might have misunderstood. Maybe 'x' is the number of packages each shipped, so the total packages shipped by each would be x for Sarah and x for Ryan.

So, let me calculate the LCM of 18 and 11. \n\nSince 11 is a prime number and doesn't divide into 18, the LCM of 18 and 11 is just 18 multiplied by 11. Let me compute that: 18 times 11 is 198. So, the LCM is 198. That means both Sarah and Ryan would need to ship 198 packages each to use their trucks completely without any leftover space. \n\nWait, but hold on.

Now, I'll check which of these numbers also divide 120 evenly.\n\n120 divided by 1 is 120, so 1 is a factor. 120 divided by 2 is 60, so 2 is a factor. 120 divided by 3 is 40, so 3 is a factor. 120 divided by 5 is 24, so 5 is a factor. 120 divided by 6 is 20, so 6 is a factor. 120 divided by 10 is 12, so 10 is a factor. 120 divided by 15 is 8, so 15 is a factor. 120 divided by 30 is 4, so 30 is a factor.\n\nSo, the common factors of 120 and 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30. The largest one is 30.\n\nTherefore, the largest number of students she can have is 30, with each student getting 4 crayons (120 ÷ 30 = 4) and 1 piece of paper (30 ÷ 30 = 1).\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{30}","ground_truth":"30","predicted_answer":"30","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

The greatest common factor (GCF) of these two numbers will give me the maximum number of bags she can make.\n\nLet me list the factors of each number:\n- Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\n- Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\nNow, I'll identify the common factors from both lists. The common factors are 1, 2, 3, and 6. Out of these, the greatest one is 6.\n\nTo confirm, if I divide both 18 and 12 by 6:\n- 18 ÷ 6 = 3\n- 12 ÷ 6 = 2\n\nThis means each snack bag will have 3 chocolate bars and 2 cookies. Since both numbers divide evenly, there are no leftovers, and 6 is indeed the maximum number of bags she can make.\n</think>\n\nThe greatest number of snack bags is determined by finding the greatest common factor (GCF) of 18 and 12.\n\n- Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18\n- Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12\n\nThe common factors are 1, 2, 3, and 6.

So for 2, it's 2^2; for 3, it's 3^2; for 7, it's 7^1; and for 11, it's 11^1.\n\nMultiplying these together: 2^2 * 3^2 * 7 * 11.\n\nCalculating that:\n\n2^2 = 4\n\n3^2 = 9\n\n4 * 9 = 36\n\n36 * 7 = 252\n\n252 * 11 = 2772\n\nSo, the LCM is 2772 seconds. That means after 2772 seconds, both P and Q will have completed an integer number of rounds and meet again at the starting point.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Maybe I should verify the LCM calculation.\n\nAlternatively, I can use the formula for LCM using the greatest common divisor (GCD). The formula is LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b).\n\nFirst, find GCD(252, 198). Let's use the Euclidean algorithm.\n\n252 divided by 198 is 1 with a remainder of 54.\n\nNow, GCD(198, 54). 198 divided by 54 is 3 with a remainder of 36.\n\nThen, GCD(54, 36). 54 divided by 36 is 1 with a remainder of 18.\n\nGCD(36, 18). 36 divided by 18 is 2 with a remainder of 0. So, GCD is 18.\n\nNow, LCM = (252 * 198) / 18.\n\nCalculating 252 * 198: 252 * 200 = 50,400, minus 252 * 2 = 504, so 50,400 - 504 = 50,896.\n\nThen, divide by 18: 50,896 / 18 = 2,827.555... Wait, that doesn't make sense because LCM should be an integer. Did I do the multiplication wrong?\n\nWait, 252 * 198. Let me calculate it step by step.\n\n252 * 100 = 25,200\n\n252 * 90 = 22,680\n\n252 * 8 = 2,016\n\nAdding them up: 25,200 + 22,680 = 47,880; 47,880 + 2,016 = 49,896.\n\nNow, 49,896 divided by 18: 18 * 2,772 = 49,896. So, yes, the LCM is 2,772. So my initial calculation was correct.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 2,772 seconds.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{2772}","ground_truth":"2772","predicted_answer":"2772","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. To find the LCM, I can break down both numbers into their prime factors. \n\nLet's see, 75 can be factored into 3 * 5 * 5, and 30 can be factored into 2 * 3 * 5. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors present in either number. So, that would be 2 * 3 * 5 * 5, which is 150. \n\nThis means every 150th customer gets both a free drink and a free bag of popcorn. Now, we have a total of 3,000 customers. To find out how many times the 150th customer number appears within 3,000, I can divide 3,000 by 150. \n\nCalculating that, 3,000 divided by 150 equals 20. So, there are 20 customers who received both free items. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. If every 150th customer gets both, then the number of customers who get both is indeed 3,000 divided by 150, which is 20. Yeah, that makes sense.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{20}","ground_truth":"20","predicted_answer":"20","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

If we have 20 students, each can get 1 cookie and 1 slice. If we have more students, say 10, each can get 2 cookies and 2 slices. If we have 5 students, each can get 4 cookies and 4 slices. If we have 4 students, each can get 5 cookies and 5 slices. If we have 2 students, each can get 10 cookies and 20 slices. If we have 1 student, they get all the cookies and slices.\n\nSo, the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices each student can get is when there are 20 students, each getting 1 cookie and 1 slice. That seems correct because it's the maximum number of students that can be served without leftovers.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices the students can each get.\" So, if there are more students, each can get fewer. So, to maximize the number each student gets, we need to minimize the number of students. The smallest number of students that can be served without leftovers is 20, which means each student gets 1 cookie and 1 slice.\n\nTherefore, the greatest number of cookies and pizza slices each student can get is 1 each.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{1}","ground_truth":"20","predicted_answer":"1","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

I think I need to find out the maximum daily distance they can bike so that the distance each covers each day is equal.\n\nLet me denote the maximum distance they can bike each day as 'd'.

I think I need to calculate the total cost for those 4 months and then add it to the cost of one phone.\n\nLet me start by calculating the total cost for the 4 months. If I pay $7 each month, then over 4 months, the total cost would be:\n\n$7/month * 4 months = $28.\n\nOkay, so the total cost for the 4 months is $28. Now, the company is offering a special where I pay $2 each phone. So, if I buy one phone, that's an additional $2. \n\nNow, I need to add the cost of the phone to the total cost for the 4 months. That would be:\n\n$28 (for the 4 months) + $2 (for the phone) = $30.\n\nSo, the total cost for buying one phone would be $30.\n</think>\n\nThe total cost for buying one phone, including the 4 months' subscription, is $30.\n\n\\boxed{30}","ground_truth":"30","predicted_answer":"30","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

I need to add those 10 students back to the count. \n\nAdding 10 students to the previous count of 25 students gives me a total of 35 students at the end of the year. Hmm, that seems a bit surprising because the number of students didn't change. It's interesting because the number of students leaving and arriving are the same. \n\nLet me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with 35 students, subtracting 10 gives 25, and then adding 10 brings it back to 35. Yeah, that makes sense. \n\nI think I've got it right. The number of students at the end of the year is 35.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{35}","ground_truth":"35","predicted_answer":"35","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}
