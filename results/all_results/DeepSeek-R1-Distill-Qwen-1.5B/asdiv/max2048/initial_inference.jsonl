So, Marcus has 210 baseball cards, and he has 58 more than Carter. That means if I subtract 58 from Marcus's total, I should get Carter's total.\n\nWait, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. If Marcus has 58 more than Carter, then Carter's number of cards plus 58 equals Marcus's number. So, mathematically, I can represent this as:\n\nMarcus's cards = Carter's cards + 58\n\nGiven that Marcus has 210 cards, I can substitute that into the equation:\n\n210 = Carter's cards + 58\n\nTo find Carter's cards, I need to isolate Carter's cards on one side.

But wait, the question says \"including Buddy, there were 39 students that got on the bus.\" Hmm, does that mean Buddy is included in the 39 students? That would mean the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is 39 students, not counting Buddy. Or does it mean Buddy plus 39 students? I need to clarify that.\n\nThe question says, \"Including Buddy, there were 39 students that got on the bus.\" So, that probably means Buddy plus 39 students, making it 40 people in total on the bus after the first stop. Let me confirm that.\n\nNext, at the second stop, 29 more students got on the bus. So, I need to add those 29 students to the current total. If after the first stop there are 40 people on the bus, adding 29 more would give me the total after the second stop.\n\nSo, calculating that: 40 (after first stop) + 29 (second stop) = 69 students on the bus in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If 39 students got on the bus with Buddy, that's 39 + 1 (Buddy) = 40. Then 29 more got on, so 40 + 29 = 69. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI think I got it!\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{69}","ground_truth":"68","predicted_answer":"69","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}

So, I need to add the number of fireflies to the number of glow worms.\n\nLet me write that down: total animals = number of fireflies + number of glow worms. Plugging in the numbers, that would be 432 + 297.\n\nNow, I'll do the addition. Let me add 432 and 297. I'll start by adding the units place: 2 + 7 = 9. Then the tens place: 3 + 9 = 12, so I'll write down 2 and carry over 1. Finally, the hundreds place: 4 + 2 = 6, plus the carried-over 1 makes 7. So putting it all together, it's 729.\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 432 + 297: 400 + 200 is 600, 30 + 90 is 120, and 2 + 7 is 9.

Therefore, the number of packs remaining would be 43 minus 31.\n\nLet me do the subtraction: 43 - 31 = 12.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If I have 43 and take away 31, I should get 12. Yes, that makes sense. So, 43 - 31 equals 12.\n\nTherefore, the number of wolf packs left in the forest is 12.\n\nI think that's it. It wasn't too complicated.

To do that, I can subtract the amount he already has from the total he wants. So, 333 liters minus 157 liters. Let me calculate that. \n\n333 minus 157... Let me break it down. 300 minus 100 is 200, 33 minus 50 is 3, and 3 minus 7 can't be done, so I have to borrow from the hundreds place. So, 300 becomes 299, and 33 becomes 63. Then, 63 minus 7 is 56. Adding that to the 200, I get 256. So, 333 minus 157 equals 176. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my subtraction again.\n\nWait, 157 plus 176 equals 333. Let me add them up. 157 plus 100 is 257, plus 70 is 327, plus 6 is 333. Okay, that checks out. So, he needs 176 more liters of paint to reach the total he wants.\n\nBut wait, the question says he has 157 liters left from his last project, and he wants to use 333 liters. So, actually, he needs 333 minus 157, which is 176 liters. So, the answer should be 176 liters.\n\nWait, but let me make sure I'm not mixing anything up. Is he using 333 liters in total, and he already has 157 liters left, so he needs 333 minus 157 more. Yes, that makes sense. So, the calculation is correct.\n</think>\n\nThe final answer is the amount of additional paint needed, which is 176 liters.\n\n\\boxed{176}","ground_truth":"176","predicted_answer":"176","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

{"id":348,"question":"Being a nature lover, she also gave some money to three forest reserves. If she donated $570.00 to Treetown National Park and The Forest Reserve which is $140.00 more than what she gave to Animal Preservation Park, how much did she donate to all three parks?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let me try to figure out how much money the person donated to all three parks. So, she gave $570 to three parks: Treetown National Park and The Forest Reserve, and Animal Preservation Park. The amount given to Treetown and The Forest Reserve is $140 more than what she gave to Animal Preservation Park. I need to find the total she donated to all three parks.\n\nFirst, let's denote the amount she donated to Animal Preservation Park as \\( x \\). Then, the total donation to Treetown and The Forest Reserve would be \\( x + 140 \\). Since she gave $570 in total, the sum of the donations to all three parks should equal 570. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\nx + (x + 140) = 570\n\\]\n\nSimplifying this equation:\n\n\\[\n2x + 140 = 570\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 140 from both sides:\n\n\\[\n2x = 430\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = 215\n\\]\n\nSo, she donated $215 to Animal Preservation Park. The donations to the other two parks would be \\( 215 + 140 = 355 \\) each. To find the total donation, I add all three amounts:\n\n\\[\n215 + 355 + 355 = 925\n\\]\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because the total should be 570. Let me check my calculations. Oh, I see, I made a mistake in setting up the equation. The total donation is 570, so the correct equation should be:\n\n\\[\nx + (x + 140) = 570\n\\]\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n2x + 140 = 570\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 140:\n\n\\[\n2x = 430\n\\]\n\nDividing by 2:\n\n\\[\nx = 215\n\\]\n\nSo, Animal Preservation Park gets $215, and the other two parks get $215 + $140 = $355 each. Adding them up:\n\n215 + 355 + 355 = 925\n\nWait, that's still more than 570. I must have messed up the equation. Let me try again. The total donation is 570, so:\n\nx (Animal Preservation) + (x + 140) (Treetown and Forest) = 570\n\nSo, x + x + 140 = 570\n\n2x + 140 = 570\n\n2x = 430\n\nx = 215\n\nTherefore, Animal Preservation Park: $215, Treetown and Forest: $355 each. Total: 215 + 355 + 355 = 925. But that's more than 570. I must have misread the question.\n\nWait, the total donation is 570, so maybe I need to adjust. Let me try solving it again.\n\nLet x be the donation to Animal Preservation Park. Then Treetown and Forest get x + 140. Total is x + (x + 140) = 570.\n\nSo, 2x + 140 = 570\n\n2x = 430\n\nx = 215\n\nSo, Animal Preservation: $215, Treetown and Forest: $355 each. Total: 215 + 355 + 355 = 925. But that's more than 570. I'm confused. Maybe the total is 570, so I need to find x such that x + (x + 140) = 570.\n\nBut solving gives x = 215, leading to total 925, which is more than 570. That can't be right. Maybe I misunderstood the problem.\n\nWait, the question says she donated $570 to Treetown National Park and The Forest Reserve, which is $140 more than what she gave to Animal Preservation Park. So, Treetown and Forest Reserve total is $570, which is $140 more than Animal Preservation Park. Therefore, Animal Preservation Park got $570 - $140 = $430. Then Treetown and Forest Reserve got $570 each. But that would make the total more than 570.\n\nI think the correct approach is that the total donation to Treetown and Forest Reserve is $570, which is $140 more than what was given to Animal Preservation Park. So, if Treetown and Forest Reserve got $570, then Animal Preservation Park got $570 - $140 = $430. Then, the total donation is $570 (Treetown and Forest) + $430 (Animal Preservation) = $1000. But the question says she donated $570 to Treetown and Forest Reserve, which is $140 more than what she gave to Animal Preservation Park. So, the total is $570, and she donated $430 to Animal Preservation Park and $570 to Treetown and Forest Reserve. Therefore, the total is $430 + $570 = $1000. But the question might be asking for the total, which is 1000.\n\nWait, the question is: \"how much did she donate to all three parks?\" So, it's 430 + 570 = 1000.

So, the amount given to Animal Preservation Park is 570 - 140 = 430. Then, the total donation is 430 (Animal) + 570 (Treetown and Forest) = 1000.

So, I need to compute 96 divided by 8. Let me do that step by step.\n\n96 divided by 8. I know that 8 times 12 is 96 because 8 times 10 is 80 and 8 times 2 is 16, and 80 plus 16 is 96. So, 8 times 12 equals 96. That means Charles reads the entire book in 12 days.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If he reads 8 pages each day, then over 12 days, he would have read 8 multiplied by 12, which is indeed 96 pages. So, that seems correct.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe using division. 96 divided by 8 is the same as asking how many times 8 fits into 96. As I calculated earlier, 8 goes into 96 twelve times. So, that confirms it.\n\nI don't think there's any other factor or detail that could change the number of days. The problem is straightforward. Charles reads a consistent number of pages each day, and the total number of pages is given. So, the answer should be 12 days.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{12}","ground_truth":"12","predicted_answer":"12","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Adding those together, 1200 + 196 equals 1396. So, 349 frogs would have 1396 legs in total.\n\nWait, let me double-check that multiplication to be sure. 349 × 4:\n\n- 9 × 4 = 36, write down 6 and carry over 3.\n- 4 × 4 = 16, plus the carried 3 is 19, write down 9 and carry over 1.\n- 3 × 4 = 12, plus the carried 1 is 13.\n\nSo, putting it together, it's 1396. Yeah, that seems correct.\n\nI don't think there are any special cases here, like frogs with more or fewer legs, so I don't need to adjust for any exceptions. The problem seems straightforward.\n\nSo, the final answer is that 349 frogs have a total of 1396 legs.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{1396}","ground_truth":"1396","predicted_answer":"1396","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

That seems straightforward, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.\n\nWait a second, maybe I should consider if there are any additional factors I'm missing, like whether the car has any other components that affect fuel efficiency or if there's a different rate for partial gallons. But the question doesn't mention anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume it's a simple 20 miles per gallon.\n\nAnother way to think about it is to consider how many miles I can drive with each gallon and then add them up. So, with 5 gallons, I can drive 20 miles each time, so 5 times 20 is still 100. Yeah, that checks out.\n\nI don't think there's any trick or hidden detail here that I'm missing. It's a basic rate problem, so the answer should be straightforward. I don't need to complicate it further. I'll stick with 100 miles as the answer.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{100}","ground_truth":"100","predicted_answer":"100","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

I cleaned out his ears, and now I need to find out how many fleas died.\n\nFirst, I should add up all the fleas. There are 36 fleas in his right ear and 85 in his left ear. So, 36 plus 85 equals... let me calculate that. 36 plus 85 is 121 fleas in total. So, the total number of fleas in both ears is 121.\n\nNow, I need to determine how many of these fleas perished. The problem doesn't specify how many fleas survived, so I might need to make an assumption here. Since the question is asking for the number of fleas that perished, and it's not provided, I can't calculate an exact number. However, if I consider that all fleas died, then the total number of fleas perished would be 121.\n\nAlternatively, if I assume that some fleas survived, I would need more information, like the number of surviving fleas or the survival rate. Without that, I can't make a precise calculation.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is implying that all fleas died? Let me check the wording again. It says, \"How many fleas perished?\" and gives the total number in both ears. Since there's no indication of survivors, I think the safe assumption is that all fleas died. So, the total perished would be the sum of both ears, which is 36 plus 85, equaling 121 fleas.\n\nI should also consider if there's any mention of surviving fleas or if any fleas died due to the earache. But since there's no information about surviving fleas, I can only conclude that all fleas died. Therefore, the number of fleas perished is 121.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{121}","ground_truth":"121","predicted_answer":"121","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

{"id":738,"question":"The capacity of a tank is 32 gallons. If a company bought 728 gallons of oil, how many tanks are needed to hold all the oil?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many tanks are needed to hold 728 gallons of oil if each tank can hold 32 gallons. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that each tank can hold 32 gallons. The company bought a total of 728 gallons. To find out how many tanks are needed, I should divide the total amount of oil by the capacity of one tank. That makes sense because dividing will tell me how many times 32 gallons fits into 728 gallons.\n\nSo, the calculation would be 728 divided by 32. Let me do that division. \n\n728 ÷ 32. Hmm, 32 times 20 is 640. Subtracting 640 from 728 leaves 88. Now, 32 goes into 88 twice (since 32*2=64), which leaves 24 remaining. 32 goes into 24 zero times, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, we can't have a fraction of a tank.

I need to find out how many laptops will be in each row. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that dividing 44 laptops into 5 rows means I have to perform division. Specifically, I need to divide 44 by 5. But wait, dividing 44 by 5 might not be an integer, so there might be a remainder. Let me check that.\n\n44 divided by 5. Well, 5 times 8 is 40, and 44 minus 40 is 4. So, 44 divided by 5 is 8 with a remainder of 4. That means each row will have 8 laptops, and there will be 4 laptops left over. But since Mike is dividing them equally into 5 rows, I think the question is asking for the number of laptops per row, which would be 8 with a remainder of 4. However, if we're considering whole numbers, each row would have 8 laptops, and 4 would be extra.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"divided equally into 5 rows.\" So, if it's exactly divided, maybe 44 divided by 5 is 8.8, but since we can't have a fraction of a laptop in a row, it's likely that some rows will have 8 and some will have 9 to account for the remainder. But I'm not sure if the question expects an exact division or just the integer part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to present it as 8 with a remainder of 4. But the question specifically asks for the number of laptops in each row, so perhaps it's looking for the exact number, which would be 8 with 4 left over. However, in math problems like this, sometimes we just take the integer part, so 8.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. 5 times 8 is 40, and 44 minus 40 is 4. So, yes, 44 divided by 5 is 8 with a remainder of 4. So each row has 8, and there are 4 left. But since Mike is dividing them equally, maybe the remainder is also distributed somehow, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the integer part, which is 8.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the problem is in whole numbers, we can say that each row has 8, and there are 4 left over. But I think the question is asking for the number of laptops per row, so it's 8 with a remainder of 4. But since the problem is in a math context, perhaps it's expecting an exact division, so 8 with a remainder of 4, but as an integer, it's 8.\n\nWait, but in reality, you can't have a fraction of a laptop, so you would have to have some rows with 8 and some with 9 to account for the remainder. But since the question doesn't specify how to distribute the remainder, it's probably acceptable to say that each row has 8, and there are 4 left over. So the answer is 8 per row with a remainder of 4.\n\nAlternatively, if we're to present it as a division equation, it would be 44 ÷ 5 = 8 with a remainder of 4, or 44 = 5*8 + 4.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many laptops are in each row, so it's 8 per row, with 4 remaining. However, since the question doesn't specify how to handle the remainder, it's safer to assume that each row has 8, and the remainder is not counted. So the answer is 8 per row.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"divided equally into 5 rows,\" which might imply that the division is exact, so perhaps the remainder is also distributed. But in reality, you can't have a fraction of a laptop, so it's more likely that the division is not exact, and some rows will have 8, and some will have 9 to make up the total of 44.\n\nLet me calculate that. If each row has 8, that's 5 rows * 8 = 40. But we have 44, so 4 more. So we can add 1 to 4 of the rows, making those rows have 9 instead of 8. So 4 rows have 9 and 1 row has 8, totaling 4*9 + 1*8 = 36 + 8 = 44. So each row has either 8 or 9 laptops, with 4 rows having 9 and 1 row having 8.\n\nBut the question is asking for how many laptops are in each row, not the distribution. So perhaps it's expecting the average, which is 8.8, but since you can't have a fraction, it's unclear. However, in the context of dividing equally, it's more likely that each row has 8, with 4 left over.\n\nBut in the initial division, 44 ÷ 5 is 8.8, which is 8 with a remainder of 4. So, if we're to present it as a whole number, it's 8 per row. However, since the total isn't perfectly divisible, there's a remainder. But the question doesn't specify how to handle it, so perhaps it's acceptable to present the integer part, which is 8.\n\nAlternatively, if we're to present the exact division, it's 8 with a remainder of 4, so each row has 8 and there's 4 left. But the question is about how many laptops are in each row, so maybe it's better to present the exact division.\n\nWait, but 44 divided by 5 is 8.8, which can be written as 8 and 4/5, but since we're dealing with whole numbers, it's 8 with a remainder of 4. So, in terms of division, it's 8.8, but as whole numbers, it's 8 with 4 left over. But the problem is asking for the number of laptops in each row, so perhaps it's 8 per row.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused because the total isn't a multiple of 5, so it's not perfectly divisible. Therefore, the answer is that each row has 8 laptops, and there are 4 left over, but the exact number per row is 8.8, which isn't possible. So the answer is 8 per row, with 4 remaining.\n\nBut I'm not sure if the question expects an integer or not. It just says \"how many laptops are there in each row,\" so maybe it's 8.8, but that's not practical. So, perhaps the answer is 8 per row, with 4 remaining, but since we can't have fractions, it's better to say 8 per row.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects the exact division, so 8.8, but since we can't have decimals, it's 8 with a remainder. But the problem might expect the integer part, so 8.\n\nWait, let me check again. 5 rows of 8 is 40, and 44 - 40 is 4, so 4 left. So, each row has 8, and 4 are left. So, the answer is 8 per row, with 4 remaining. But the question is asking for the number in each row, so it's 8.\n\nAlternatively, if the problem expects an exact division, it's 8.8 per row, but that's not practical. So, perhaps the answer is 8 per row, with 4 remaining, but since the question is about the number in each row, it's 8.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you divide 44 by 5, you get 8 with a remainder of 4, so each row has 8, and 4 are left.

But the question is asking for the number in each row, so it's 8.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the remainder is distributed, then 4 rows have 9 and 1 row has 8, totaling 44.

I need to find out how many laptops will be in each row. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I know that dividing 44 laptops into 5 rows means I have to perform division. Specifically, I need to divide 44 by 5. But wait, dividing 44 by 5 might not be an integer, so there might be a remainder. Let me check that.\n\n44 divided by 5. Well, 5 times 8 is 40, and 44 minus 40 is 4. So, 44 divided by 5 is 8 with a remainder of 4. That means each row will have 8 laptops, and there will be 4 laptops left over. But since Mike is dividing them equally into 5 rows, I think the question is asking for the number of laptops per row, which would be 8 with a remainder of 4.

But I'm not sure if the question expects an exact division or just the integer part.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's better to present it as 8 with a remainder of 4. But the question specifically asks for the number of laptops in each row, so perhaps it's looking for the exact number, which would be 8 with 4 left over. However, in math problems like this, sometimes we just take the integer part, so 8.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. 5 times 8 is 40, and 44 minus 40 is 4. So, yes, 44 divided by 5 is 8 with a remainder of 4. So each row has 8, and there are 4 left.

Let me calculate that.\n\n3,730 divided by 73. Let me see how many times 73 goes into 3,730.\n\nFirst, I can simplify the division by seeing how many times 73 fits into 3,730.

Let's see: 73 * 5 = 365, which is less than 373. 73 * 6 = 438, which is too much. So, it goes 5 times.\n\nSubtract 365 from 373, which gives me 8. Bring down the next digit, which is 0. So now I have 80.\n\n73 goes into 80 once. 73 * 1 = 73. Subtract that from 80, and I get 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 73 goes into 3730 exactly 51 times with a remainder of 7. Wait, that can't be right because 73 * 51 = 3723, and 3730 - 3723 = 7, so the remainder is 7.\n\nBut wait, that doesn't make sense because 73 * 51 is 3723, which is less than 3730 by 7, so the total number of pieces is 51 with a remainder of 7 cm.

But since we're asked for the number of 73 cm pieces, the answer is 51.\n\nAlternatively, if we were to include the remainder, it would be 51 pieces with 7 cm left over, but the question asks for how many pieces, so the answer is 51.","full_output":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many 73 cm pieces Sam can make from a 3,730 cm long ribbon.

If each piece was 73 cm long, how much of the original ribbon was left?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I have this problem where Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon. Each piece is 73 cm long. I need to find out how much ribbon is left after cutting as many equal pieces as possible. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that to find the total length of ribbon used, I can multiply the number of pieces by the length of each piece. But I don't know how many pieces Sam cut. Maybe I can find that by dividing the total length by the length of each piece. So, 3,730 cm divided by 73 cm per piece.\n\nLet me do that division: 3,730 ÷ 73. I'm not sure exactly how many times 73 goes into 3,730, but I can estimate. 73 times 50 is 3,650. That's close to 3,730. Subtracting 3,650 from 3,730 gives me 80. So, 50 pieces would use 3,650 cm, leaving 80 cm. But 80 cm isn't enough for another full piece of 73 cm because 73 cm is less than 80 cm.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the total number of students is 90. The goal is to divide them into two types of groups: large groups with 7 members each and small groups with 3 members each. The aim is to minimize the total number of groups. \n\nI think I should start by figuring out how many small groups I can make if I only use the small groups. If each small group has 3 students, then the number of small groups would be 90 divided by 3. Let me calculate that: 90 ÷ 3 = 30. So, if I make only small groups, I would have 30 groups in total.\n\nBut wait, the problem allows me to use both large and small groups. Maybe using some large groups can reduce the total number of groups. I should explore that possibility.\n\nLet me denote the number of large groups as L and the number of small groups as S. The total number of students can be represented by the equation:\n\n7L + 3S = 90\n\nMy goal is to minimize the total number of groups, which is L + S. To minimize L + S, I need to find values of L and S that satisfy the equation while keeping their sum as small as possible.\n\nI can start by expressing one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for S:\n\n3S = 90 - 7L\nS = (90 - 7L) / 3\n\nSince S must be an integer, (90 - 7L) must be divisible by 3. Let's see what values of L will make this true.\n\n7L modulo 3 should be equal to 90 modulo 3. Since 90 is divisible by 3, 7L must also be congruent to 0 modulo 3. But 7 is congruent to 1 modulo 3, so this simplifies to L ≡ 0 modulo 3. Therefore, L must be a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's try L = 0: Then S = (90 - 0)/3 = 30. So total groups = 0 + 30 = 30.\n\nNext, L = 3: Then S = (90 - 21)/3 = 69/3 = 23. Total groups = 3 + 23 = 26.\n\nL = 6: S = (90 - 42)/3 = 48/3 = 16.

First, we know that there are 250 vitamins in a bottle. Gil takes 12 vitamins each day. We need to find out how many vitamins he would have taken by the day the bottle runs out and how many he is short of his usual 12.\n\nSo, we can start by dividing the total number of vitamins by the number he takes each day. That gives us 250 divided by 12. Let me do that calculation: 250 ÷ 12 equals approximately 20.8333 days. Since Gil can't take a fraction of a day, we'll round this up to 21 days because on the 21st day, he would have taken more than his usual 12.\n\nNow, to find out how many vitamins he would have taken in 21 days, we multiply 21 by 12.

{"id":789,"question":"A school buys 1,093 chairs. If it wants to distribute them equally into 35 classrooms, how many more chairs should be purchased?","chain_of_thought":"Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the school has bought 1,093 chairs and wants to distribute them equally into 35 classrooms. The question is asking how many more chairs need to be purchased so that each classroom gets an equal number.\n\nFirst, I need to find out how many chairs each classroom would get if the 1,093 chairs are divided equally among 35 classrooms. To do this, I'll perform the division of 1,093 by 35.\n\nLet me set up the division: 1,093 ÷ 35. I'll start by seeing how many times 35 goes into 109, which is the first two digits of 1,093. 35 times 3 is 105, which is less than 109. So, 3 times 35 is 105. Subtracting that from 109 leaves a remainder of 4. Bringing down the next digit, which is 3, making it 43. Now, I'll see how many times 35 goes into 43. It goes once, which is 35, leaving a remainder of 8. Since there are no more digits to bring down, I'll note the remainder.\n\nSo, 1,093 divided by 35 is 31 with a remainder of 8. This means that each classroom would get 31 chairs, and there would be 8 chairs left over. Since the school wants to distribute the chairs equally, they need to ensure that each classroom gets the same number of chairs, so they can't leave any chairs unused. Therefore, they need to purchase enough chairs to cover the remaining 8 chairs.\n\nBut wait, if each classroom already has 31 chairs and there are 8 chairs left, they need to add 8 more chairs to make it 39 chairs per classroom. Let me double-check that: 35 classrooms times 39 chairs each would be 35 * 39. Calculating that, 35*40 is 1,400, minus 35 gives 1,365. Adding the 8 extra chairs brings the total to 1,373 chairs. However, since the question asks how many more chairs need to be purchased, and we have 8 chairs left over, they need to add 8 more chairs to cover the remainder.\n\nBut wait again, maybe I made a miscalculation. Let me try another approach. If 35 classrooms each get 31 chairs, that's 35*31. 35*30 is 1,050, plus 35 is 1,085. So, 1,085 chairs are distributed, leaving 8 chairs unused. Therefore, they need to purchase 8 more chairs to have a total of 1,093 chairs, which can then be divided equally among the 35 classrooms with 31 chairs each.\n\nWait, that doesn't seem right because 35*31 is 1,085, and 1,093 - 1,085 is 8. So, they need to add 8 chairs to reach 1,093. Alternatively, if they want to have 31 chairs per classroom without any remainder, they need to add enough chairs to make the total number divisible by 35. The next multiple of 35 after 1,093 is 35*31=1,085, which is less than 1,093, so the next multiple is 35*32=1,120. The difference between 1,120 and 1,093 is 27, so they need to purchase 27 more chairs.\n\nBut this contradicts the earlier calculation. I think I need to clarify. The problem states that the school has bought 1,093 chairs and wants to distribute them equally into 35 classrooms. It doesn't specify whether they want no remainder or not. Since they want to distribute them equally, I think the correct approach is to divide 1,093 by 35 and see how many more chairs are needed to make the division exact.\n\nSo, 1,093 ÷ 35 is approximately 31.228 chairs per classroom. Since they can't have a fraction of a chair, they need to round up to the next whole number, which is 32 chairs per classroom. Therefore, the total number of chairs needed is 35*32=1,120 chairs. Since they already have 1,093 chairs, they need to purchase 1,120 - 1,093 = 27 more chairs.\n\nBut the problem says \"how many more chairs should be purchased,\" so the answer is 27 chairs.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought they needed 8 chairs to cover the remainder when dividing 1,093 by 35. That approach would result in 31 chairs per classroom with 8 chairs left over, which might not be ideal.

To find the weight of one plastic bottle, divide 250 g by 5:\n\nWeight of 1 plastic bottle = 250 g ÷ 5 = 50 g.\n\nNow, to find out how much heavier a glass bottle is compared to a plastic bottle, subtract the weight of a plastic bottle from the weight of a glass bottle:\n\n200 g (glass) - 50 g (plastic) = 150 g.\n\nSo, a glass bottle is 150 grams heavier than a plastic bottle.\n</think>\n\nThe weight of 3 glass bottles is 600 g, so each glass bottle weighs 200 g. The total weight of 4 glass bottles and 5 plastic bottles is 1 kg 50 g (1050 g). Since 4 glass bottles weigh 800 g, the 5 plastic bottles weigh 250 g, making each plastic bottle 50 g. Therefore, a glass bottle is 150 g heavier than a plastic bottle.\n\n\\boxed{150}","ground_truth":"150","predicted_answer":"150","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

{"id":811,"question":"I put another number into my machine. The machine added 15 and then subtracted 6. The number 35 came out of the machine. What number did I put in?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, the question is: I put another number into my machine. The machine added 15 and then subtracted 6. The number 35 came out of the machine. What number did I put in?\n\nHmm, so the machine does two operations: first, it adds 15, and then it subtracts 6. The result after these operations is 35. I need to find out what the original number was before these operations.\n\nLet me think about this. If the machine starts with a number, let's call it \\( x \\). Then it adds 15 to it, so that becomes \\( x + 15 \\). After that, it subtracts 6, so the final result is \\( (x + 15) - 6 \\). According to the problem, this final result is 35. So, I can set up the equation:\n\n\\[ (x + 15) - 6 = 35 \\]\n\nNow, I need to solve for \\( x \\). Let me simplify the left side of the equation first. Combining 15 and -6 gives me:\n\n\\[ x + (15 - 6) = x + 9 \\]\n\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ x + 9 = 35 \\]\n\nTo solve for \\( x \\), I need to isolate it. I can do this by subtracting 9 from both sides of the equation:\n\n\\[ x + 9 - 9 = 35 - 9 \\]\n\nSimplifying both sides:\n\n\\[ x = 26 \\]\n\nSo, the original number I put into the machine was 26.

Yep, that checks out.\n\nI think that makes sense. The machine takes 26, adds 15 to get 41, and then subtracts 6 to give me the final number 35.

Each day, the worm climbs up 8 inches but then slides back 3 inches. I need to figure out how many days it will take for the worm to get out of the hole.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the situation. Every day, the worm makes a net progress. It climbs 8 inches and then slides back 3 inches. So, the net gain per day is 8 - 3 = 5 inches. That means each day, the worm is effectively moving up 5 inches.\n\nBut wait, on the last day, when the worm reaches or exceeds the top of the hole, it doesn't slide back. So, I need to consider that on the final day, it might climb out without sliding back. That means I have to calculate how many days it takes for the worm to reach just below the top, and then on the next day, it climbs out.\n\nLet me break it down. The hole is 26 inches deep. Each day, the worm's net progress is 5 inches. If I divide the total depth by the net progress per day, I get 26 / 5 = 5.2 days.

Pens come in packs of 12, and pencils come in packs of 15. He wants to buy the same number of pens and pencils. I need to find the smallest number of pens he can buy so that both pens and pencils are in whole packs.\n\nFirst, I think I need to find a common number that both 12 and 15 can divide into. That sounds like finding the least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 15. The LCM is the smallest number that both 12 and 15 can go into without leaving a remainder.\n\nTo find the LCM, I can list the multiples of each number and find the smallest one they have in common.

Both 5 and 4 are whole numbers, so that works.\n\nIs there a smaller number than 60 that both 12 and 15 can divide into? Let's check. The next smaller common multiple after 60 is 30, but 30 divided by 12 is 2.5, which isn't a whole number, and 30 divided by 15 is 2, which is a whole number. But since 2.5 isn't a whole number, 30 doesn't work.

Let's list the multiples:\n\nMultiples of 12: 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120, ...\nMultiples of 15: 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, ...\n\nLooking at these lists, the first common multiple is 60. So, the least common multiple of 12 and 15 is 60. That means Philip can buy 60 pens and 60 pencils.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure. If he buys 60 pens, how many packs does he need? Each pack has 12 pens, so 60 divided by 12 is 5 packs. Similarly, for pencils, 60 divided by 15 is 4 packs. Both 5 and 4 are whole numbers, so that works.\n\nIs there a smaller number than 60 that both 12 and 15 can divide into? Let's check. The next smaller common multiple after 60 is 30, but 30 divided by 12 is 2.5, which isn't a whole number, and 30 divided by 15 is 2, which is a whole number. But since 2.5 isn't a whole number, 30 doesn't work. So 60 is indeed the smallest number where both 12 and 15 can divide into it evenly.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of pens Philip can buy is 60.\n</think>\n\nThe smallest number of pens Philip can buy to have the same number of pens and pencils is when the number of pens and pencils is a common multiple of 12 and 15. The least common multiple (LCM) of 12 and 15 is 60. Therefore, the smallest number of pens he can buy is 60.\n\n\\boxed{60}","ground_truth":"60","predicted_answer":"60","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

So, if I take the number of computer books, which is 27, and add 15 to that, I should get the number of cookbooks.\n\nLet me write that down to make it clearer. Computer books sold = 27. Cookbooks sold = Computer books + 15. So, Cookbooks sold = 27 + 15. Calculating that, 27 plus 15 equals 42. So, they sold 42 cookbooks.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If they sold 27 computers and 15 more cooks, adding 15 to 27 gives 42. Yeah, that seems right. I don't think I made any mistakes here.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{42}","ground_truth":"42","predicted_answer":"42","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

She wants to minimize the number of coins she has. Hmm, okay, so to minimize coins, she should use as many higher denomination coins as possible. That means using quarters first and then dimes.\n\nFirst, let's recall the values:\n- A quarter is worth 25 cents.\n- A dime is worth 10 cents.\n\nKira has a total of 120 cents. I need to find out how many quarters and dimes she can use to make 120 cents with the least number of coins.\n\nLet me start by figuring out how many quarters she can use. Each quarter is 25 cents, so I'll divide the total amount by 25 to see how many quarters she can have.\n\n120 divided by 25 is 4.8. But she can't have a fraction of a quarter, so she can use 4 quarters. Let me calculate how much that is:\n\n4 quarters * 25 cents = 100 cents.\n\nSubtracting that from the total, she has 120 - 100 = 20 cents left. Now, with the remaining 20 cents, she can use dimes. Each dime is 10 cents, so 20 divided by 10 is 2. That means she can use 2 dimes.\n\nSo, in total, Kira has 4 quarters and 2 dimes. Let's add those up:\n\n4 quarters + 2 dimes = 6 coins.\n\nWait, is there a way to use fewer coins? Let me check. If she uses 3 quarters, that would be 75 cents. Then she would have 120 - 75 = 45 cents left. 45 divided by 10 is 4.5, but she can't have half a dime, so she can use 4 dimes, which is 40 cents, leaving 5 cents. Then she would have 3 quarters + 4 dimes + 1 nickel, totaling 8 coins. That's more than 6 coins, so 4 quarters and 2 dimes is better.\n\nIf she uses 5 quarters, that would be 125 cents, which is more than 120. So that's not possible.

What is the cost of a DVD player?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the problem says the ratio of the cost of a DVD player to a movie is 9:2, and the DVD player costs $63 more than the movie. Hmm, ratios can sometimes be tricky, but I think I can handle this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the ratio 9:2 means. It means that for every 9 dollars spent on a DVD player, 2 dollars were spent on a movie. So, the DVD player is more expensive than the movie.\n\nLet me assign variables to make this clearer. Let's say the cost of the movie is \\( x \\) dollars. Then, according to the ratio, the cost of the DVD player would be \\( \\frac{9}{2}x \\) because for every 2 dollars spent on the movie, 9 dollars are spent on the DVD player. Wait, actually, I think I got that backwards. The ratio is DVD player to movie, so if the movie is 2 parts, the DVD player is 9 parts.

Now, the problem also says that the DVD player costs $63 more than the movie. So, the difference between the DVD player and the movie is $63. That gives me the equation:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{2}x - x = 63\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the left side, \\( \\frac{9}{2}x - x \\) is the same as \\( \\frac{9}{2}x - \\frac{2}{2}x = \\frac{7}{2}x \\).

{"id":1076,"question":"Mike is serving vegetables at a soup kitchen. He has 15 carrot sticks and 10 baby potatoes that he wants to divide evenly, with no food left over.

If he makes 9 baskets, each basket would have:\n\nOranges: 18 ÷ 9 = 2\nPears: 27 ÷ 9 = 3\nBananas: 12 ÷ 9 = 1.333...\n\nOh, wait, bananas don't divide evenly. That can't be right.

Let me divide 836 by 38. 38 times 22 is 836 (since 38*20=760 and 38*2=76; 760+76=836). Similarly, 836 divided by 44 is 19 (since 44*19=836). So yes, both divisions result in whole numbers, confirming that 836 is indeed the LCM.\n\nTherefore, the smallest number of each battery Andy can buy is 836.","full_output":"Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Andy wants to buy AA batteries and D batteries, and he wants the same number of each. The store sells AA batteries in packs of 38 and D batteries in packs of 44. I need to find the smallest number of each battery he can buy so that both quantities are equal.\n\nFirst, I think this is a problem about finding a common multiple. Since he wants the same number of AA and D batteries, we're looking for a number that is a multiple of both 38 and 44. The smallest such number would be the least common multiple (LCM) of 38 and 44.\n\nTo find the LCM, I remember that LCM can be found by breaking the numbers down into their prime factors. Let me factorize 38 and 44.\n\n38 can be divided by 2 first, giving 19. 19 is a prime number, so the prime factors of 38 are 2 and 19.\n\nFor 44, I can divide by 2 first, which gives 22.

{"id":1119,"question":"An art museum had 15 pictures to split equally into 2 different exhibits. How many more pictures would they need to make sure each exhibit had the same amount?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I have this problem where an art museum wants to split 15 pictures equally into 2 different exhibits. They need to make sure each exhibit has the same number of pictures. Hmm, let's see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many pictures each exhibit would get if they split them equally. Since there are 15 pictures in total and 2 exhibits, I can use division to find out how many each would have. So, 15 divided by 2 equals 7.5. But wait, you can't have half a picture in an exhibit, right? That doesn't make sense because you can't split a picture into parts. So, they must have to round up or down.\n\nBut the question is asking how many more pictures they need to make sure each exhibit has the same amount. Since 7.5 isn't a whole number, they can't have the same number of whole pictures in each exhibit. So, they must have to have the same whole number, which would be 7 or 8. But since they have 15 pictures, if they put 7 in each exhibit, that's 14 pictures, leaving one out.

Therefore, they need one more picture to have 16, which can be divided equally into two exhibits with 8 each.\n\nAlternatively, if they try to have 7 pictures in each exhibit, that's 14 pictures, leaving one out.

The school has 14 students who want to sign up for a trivia team. They want to split these students equally into 4 teams. So, first, I need to figure out how many students will be on each team.\n\nTo do that, I'll divide the total number of students by the number of teams. That means 14 divided by 4.

So, the problem says that one-third of a number minus seven gives eight. I need to find the number. \n\nFirst, let me translate this into an equation. If I let the number be x, then one-third of it is (1/3)x. Minus seven from that gives (1/3)x - 7, and this equals eight. So the equation is (1/3)x - 7 = 8.\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's start by getting rid of the -7 on the left side. I can do that by adding 7 to both sides of the equation. So, (1/3)x - 7 + 7 = 8 + 7, which simplifies to (1/3)x = 15.\n\nNext, I need to isolate x. Since (1/3)x is the same as x divided by 3, I can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction.

So, that means there are two equal angles, which are the base angles, and the third angle is different.\n\nFirst, I need to recall that the sum of all angles in any triangle is 180 degrees.

{"id":1201,"question":"A field is in the shape of an equilateral triangle attached to the width of the rectangular region where width of the rectangle and side of the triangle measures the same. The length of rectangular region is 76 ft and the side of triangular region measures 42 ft. Find the perimeter of the field.","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a field that's shaped like an equilateral triangle attached to a rectangle. Both the rectangle and the triangle share the same width, which means the width of the rectangle is equal to the side length of the triangle. The rectangle's length is given as 76 feet, and the triangle's side length is 42 feet. I need to find the perimeter of the entire field.\n\nFirst, I need to visualize the field. It's an equilateral triangle, so all three sides are equal, each being 42 feet. The rectangle attached to it has a length of 76 feet and a width that's the same as the triangle's side, which is 42 feet. \n\nSince the rectangle is attached to the triangle, one of its sides is overlapping with the triangle. That means that side isn't part of the perimeter anymore. Instead, the rectangle contributes three sides to the total perimeter. The rectangle has two sides of 76 feet and one side that's attached to the triangle, so those are not included in the perimeter.\n\nSo, the rectangle contributes 76 feet (length) + 76 feet (another length) + 42 feet (the width that's not attached). That's 76 + 76 + 42.\n\nNow, the triangle has three sides, each 42 feet, but one side is attached to the rectangle, so that side isn't part of the perimeter. Therefore, the triangle contributes 42 feet + 42 feet.\n\nAdding all these together:\n\nRectangle sides: 76 + 76 + 42\nTriangle sides: 42 + 42\nTotal perimeter = (76 + 76 + 42) + (42 + 42)\n\nLet me calculate that step by step.\n\nFirst, 76 + 76 is 152.

Hmm, that seems correct.\n\nBut let me think again: the rectangle's perimeter is 76 + 76 + 42, and the triangle's perimeter is 42 + 42.

That means if I let the total number of notecards be something like N, then 3/4 of N is 12. So, mathematically, I can write this as:\n\n(3/4) * N = 12\n\nTo find N, I need to solve for it.

{"id":1246,"question":"The age of a father is equal to the sum of the ages of his 5 children. After 15 years sum of the ages of the children will be twice the age of the father. Find the age of the father.","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let's try to solve this problem step by step. So, the problem is about a father's age and his five children's ages. The father's age is equal to the sum of his five children's ages. After 15 years, the sum of the children's ages will be twice the father's age. We need to find the father's current age.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say the father's current age is F, and the total age of all five children together is C. According to the problem, F is equal to C. So, we can write that as:\n\nF = C\n\nNow, after 15 years, each child will be 15 years older. Since there are five children, the total increase in their combined ages will be 5 times 15, which is 75 years. So, in 15 years, the total age of the children will be C + 75.\n\nAt the same time, the father will be 15 years older, so his age will be F + 15.\n\nThe problem states that at that time, the sum of the children's ages will be twice the father's age. So, we can set up the equation:\n\nC + 75 = 2 * (F + 15)\n\nBut we already know from the first equation that C = F.

If the father is 45, then the total age of the children is also 45. After 15 years, each child will be 15 years older, so the total increase is 75 years.

Find the number.","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I have this problem here: In a two-digit number, the tens digit is three times the unit digit. When the number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed. I need to find the number. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's represent the two-digit number. In a two-digit number, the tens digit is in the tens place and the unit digit is in the ones place. Let me denote the unit digit as 'x'. That means the tens digit would be three times that, so it's 3x. Therefore, the actual number can be expressed as 10*(3x) + x. Simplifying that, it's 30x + x, which is 31x. So, the number is 31x.\n\nNow, the problem says that when this number is decreased by 54, the digits are reversed. So, if the original number is 31x, then decreasing it by 54 would give us a new number. Let's denote the reversed number as 10x + 3x, which is 13x. Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let me think again.\n\nIf the original number is 31x, and when decreased by 54, the digits are reversed, then the reversed number would be 10*(unit digit) + (tens digit). Since the original number has a tens digit of 3x and a unit digit of x, the reversed number should have a tens digit of x and a unit digit of 3x. So, the reversed number is 10x + 3x, which is 13x. So, the equation becomes:\n\n31x - 54 = 13x\n\nNow, I need to solve for x. Let's subtract 13x from both sides:\n\n31x - 13x - 54 = 0\n18x - 54 = 0\n\nAdding 54 to both sides:\n\n18x = 54\n\nDividing both sides by 18:\n\nx = 54 / 18\nx = 3\n\nSo, the unit digit is 3. Therefore, the tens digit is 3x = 3*3 = 9. Hence, the original number is 93.\n\nLet me verify this. The original number is 93. When I decrease it by 54, I get 93 - 54 = 39. The reversed digits of 93 are 39, which matches. Also, the tens digit of 93 is 9, and the unit digit is 3, and indeed 9 is three times 3.

So, the number is 93.\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning. The tens digit is three times the unit digit, so 9 is three times 3. When I subtract 54, I get 39, which is the reverse of 93.

If the train were 6 km/hr slower, it would take 12 hours more than the scheduled time.\n\nWe need to find the length of the journey.\n\nHmm, let's denote the original speed of the train as \\( v \\) km/hr and the original time taken as \\( t \\) hours.

Tuition itself is $704 more than room and board. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make it clearer. Let's say the cost for room and board is R dollars. Then, the tuition fee would be R plus $704, right? Because it's $704 more than room and board.\n\nSo, if R is the room and board cost, then the tuition fee T is:\nT = R + 704\n\nAnd the total cost is the sum of tuition and room and board:\nTotal = T + R = (R + 704) + R = 2R + 704\n\nWe know the total cost is $2,584, so:\n2R + 704 = 2584\n\nNow, I need to solve for R. Let me subtract 704 from both sides:\n2R = 2584 - 704\n2584 minus 704... Let me calculate that. 2584 - 700 is 1884, and then subtract 4 more to get 1880.

There's a rectangular living room that's 12 feet by 10 feet. A carpet is placed inside, and it leaves a 2-foot wide border all around it. So, the carpet itself must be smaller than the room, and the border is the area around it.\n\nTo find the area of the border, I should first figure out the dimensions of the carpet. Since the border is 2 feet wide on all sides, the carpet's length and width will each be reduced by twice the border width. That means the carpet is 2 feet shorter on both sides for length and 2 feet narrower on both sides for width.\n\nSo, the carpet's length will be 12 feet minus 2 feet times 2, which is 12 - 4 = 8 feet. Similarly, the carpet's width will be 10 feet minus 2 feet times 2, which is 10 - 4 = 6 feet.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the area of the carpet.

First, I need to find the perimeter of the square and then use that to determine the dimensions of the rectangle. After that, I can calculate the area of the rectangle.\n\nThe square has sides measuring 15 cm each. The perimeter of a square is calculated by adding up all four sides, which is 4 times the length of one side. So, the perimeter of the square is 4 * 15 cm.

I need to figure out how long it takes him to mow a 60-meter square lawn at the same rate. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should find out how long it takes Kevin to mow one meter of the lawn. Since the lawn is square and each side is 30 meters, the total area he mows is 30 meters multiplied by 30 meters, which is 900 square meters. He does this in 45 minutes. So, the time per meter would be 45 minutes divided by 900 square meters. That gives me 45/900, which simplifies to 1/20 minutes per meter. \n\nWait, that doesn't seem right. 1/20 minutes per meter is 3 seconds per meter, which seems too slow for mowing. Maybe I made a mistake. Let me try again. The total area is 30 meters times 30 meters, which is indeed 900 square meters. If he does this in 45 minutes, then the time per square meter is 45 minutes divided by 900, which is 0.05 minutes per square meter. Converting that to seconds, 0.05 minutes is 3 seconds, which still seems slow, but it's possible for a person to mow 900 square meters in 45 minutes, so maybe that's correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should think about the rate per side. If he mows 30 meters in 45 minutes, then for 60 meters, which is double, it would take him double the time, so 45 minutes times 2 equals 90 minutes. That makes more sense because doubling the length would double the time if the rate remains constant. So, instead of calculating the area and then the time, I can simply find the ratio of the lengths.\n\nThe length of the new lawn is 60 meters, which is twice the length of the original lawn (30 meters). Since the rate is constant, the time should also be twice as long. So, 45 minutes times 2 is 90 minutes. That seems much more reasonable.\n\nWait, but earlier I calculated the time per square meter as 0.05 minutes, which is 3 seconds per square meter. If the new lawn is 60 meters on each side, the area is 3600 square meters. Multiplying 3600 by 0.05 minutes gives 180 minutes, which is 3 hours. That contradicts the earlier conclusion of 90 minutes. Hmm, there must be a mistake in my calculations.\n\nLet me check again. If the original lawn is 30 meters on each side, the area is 30 * 30 = 900 square meters, and it takes 45 minutes. So the rate is 900 square meters per 45 minutes. For the new lawn, which is 60 meters on each side, the area is 60 * 60 = 3600 square meters. To find the time, I can set up a proportion: 900 square meters / 45 minutes = 3600 square meters / x minutes. Solving for x gives x = (3600 * 45) / 900.

So, she originally makes 8 pancakes that are each 10 inches in diameter. Now she wants to make smaller pancakes that are only 2 inches in diameter. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the size of the pancakes and how much area each one covers. Since the size of the pancake is given, I can calculate the area of each large pancake and each small pancake. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr², where r is the radius.\n\nFor the large pancakes:\n- Diameter = 10 inches, so radius = 5 inches.\n- Area = π * (5)² = 25π square inches.\n\nFor the small pancakes:\n- Diameter = 2 inches, so radius = 1 inch.\n- Area = π * (1)² = π square inches.\n\nNow, I can find out how many small pancakes can be made by dividing the total area of the large pancakes by the area of one small pancake.\n\nTotal area of large pancakes = 8 * 25π = 200π square inches.\n\nNumber of small pancakes = Total area of large pancakes / Area of one small pancake\n= 200π / π\n= 200.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot.

Maybe I should think about it differently. If each small pancake is 2 inches in diameter, which is 1/5th the size of the large ones, then the area of each small pancake is (1/5)² = 1/25 of the large pancake.

The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr², where r is the radius.\n\nFor the large pancakes:\n- Diameter = 10 inches, so radius = 5 inches.\n- Area = π * (5)² = 25π square inches.\n\nFor the small pancakes:\n- Diameter = 2 inches, so radius = 1 inch.\n- Area = π * (1)² = π square inches.\n\nNow, I can find out how many small pancakes can be made by dividing the total area of the large pancakes by the area of one small pancake.\n\nTotal area of large pancakes = 8 * 25π = 200π square inches.\n\nNumber of small pancakes = Total area of large pancakes / Area of one small pancake\n= 200π / π\n= 200.\n\nWait, that seems like a lot. Let me double-check. If each large pancake is 25π, and each small one is π, then 200π divided by π is indeed 200. So Grandma can make 200 small pancakes.\n\nBut that seems high. Maybe I should think about it differently. If each small pancake is 2 inches in diameter, which is 1/5th the size of the large ones, then the area of each small pancake is (1/5)² = 1/25 of the large pancake. So, each small pancake is 1/25 the area of a large one.\n\nTherefore, with 8 large pancakes, the total area is 8 * 25π = 200π, and each small pancake is π, so 200π / π = 200. Yeah, that's correct. So the answer is 200.\n</think>\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{200}.","ground_truth":"200","predicted_answer":"200","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that dividing the total length of the string by the length of each piece will give me the number of pieces. So, I need to perform the division of 414 by 7. Let me write that down: 414 ÷ 7.\n\nNow, I need to calculate 414 divided by 7. Let me do the division:\n\n7 goes into 41 four times because 7*4 is 28, which is less than 41. Subtracting 28 from 41 leaves me with 13. Bring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 134.\n\n7 goes into 134 sixteen times because 7*16 is 112. Subtracting 112 from 134 leaves me with 22. Bring down the next digit, which is 0, making it 220.\n\n7 goes into 220 thirty times because 7*30 is 210. Subtracting 210 from 220 leaves me with 10. Since there are no more digits to bring down, I add a decimal point and a zero, making it 100.\n\n7 goes into 100 fourteen times because 7*14 is 98. Subtracting 98 from 100 leaves me with 2. I can see that this division will continue with a repeating decimal, but since we're only interested in the number of full pieces, I'll stop here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 414 ÷ 7 equals 59 with a remainder of 1.

Hmm, let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that dividing the total length of the string by the length of each piece will give me the number of pieces. So, I need to perform the division of 414 by 7. Let me write that down: 414 ÷ 7.\n\nNow, I need to calculate 414 divided by 7. Let me do the division:\n\n7 goes into 41 four times because 7*4 is 28, which is less than 41. Subtracting 28 from 41 leaves me with 13. Bring down the next digit, which is 4, making it 134.\n\n7 goes into 134 sixteen times because 7*16 is 112. Subtracting 112 from 134 leaves me with 22. Bring down the next digit, which is 0, making it 220.\n\n7 goes into 220 thirty times because 7*30 is 210. Subtracting 210 from 220 leaves me with 10. Since there are no more digits to bring down, I add a decimal point and a zero, making it 100.\n\n7 goes into 100 fourteen times because 7*14 is 98. Subtracting 98 from 100 leaves me with 2. I can see that this division will continue with a repeating decimal, but since we're only interested in the number of full pieces, I'll stop here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, 414 ÷ 7 equals 59 with a remainder of 1. That means John's dad can make 59 full-sized pieces of 7 meters each, with 1 meter of string left over.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with 7*59: 7*50 is 350, and 7*9 is 63, so 350 + 63 equals 413. Oh, that's actually 1 meter less than 414. So, maybe I should have considered that.\n\nAh, right, I see where I went wrong.

So, the school has 935 students who signed up for trivia teams. They want to split these students into six teams with the same number of students on each team.

So, I'll divide 935 by 6.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 935 ÷ 6. Hmm, 6 goes into 9 once, with a remainder of 3.

That means 936 students would be perfectly divided into six teams with 156 each. But we have 935 students, so we need one more to make it 936, which would allow for an exact division.

If 935 divided by 6 is 155 with a remainder of 5, that means each team can have 155 students, and there are 5 students left.

So, I'll divide 935 by 6.\n\nLet me do that calculation: 935 ÷ 6. Hmm, 6 goes into 9 once, with a remainder of 3. Then, bring down the 3 to make 33. 6 goes into 33 five times, which is 30, leaving a remainder of 3. Bring down the 5 to make 35. 6 goes into 35 five times again, which is 30, leaving a remainder of 5.\n\nSo, 935 divided by 6 is 155 with a remainder of 5. That means each team can have 155 students, and there will be 5 students left who can't be evenly distributed.\n\nTo make it fair, we need to have an exact number of students per team. Since we have a remainder of 5, we need to cover that. Each team can take one more student, so we need 6 more students to make the total number of students 935 + 6 = 941.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If each team has 156 students, then 6 teams times 156 is 6 * 156. Let me calculate that: 6 * 150 is 900, and 6 * 6 is 36, so 900 + 36 = 936. That means 936 students would be perfectly divided into six teams with 156 each. But we have 935 students, so we need one more to make it 936, which would allow for an exact division. Therefore, we need 1 more student.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me clarify. If 935 divided by 6 is 155 with a remainder of 5, that means each team can have 155 students, and there are 5 students left. To make the division exact, we need to add enough students so that the total number is divisible by 6. The next multiple of 6 after 935 is 936, so we need 936 - 935 = 1 more student.\n\nSo, the correct number of additional students needed is 1.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{1}","ground_truth":"1","predicted_answer":"1","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

Hmm, let me do this calculation step by step to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, I know that 5 times 40 is 200. So, 225 minus 200 is 25. Then, I have 25 seeds left. How many times does 5 go into 25? That's 5 times. So, adding that to the 40, I get 45. So, 5 times 45 is 225.

I've broken it down, and the answer checks out.","full_output":"Okay, so I have this math problem to solve, and I need to figure out how many seeds the farmer planted each day. Let me read the problem again carefully: The farmer had 225 seeds and planted the same number each day over 5 days.

Since he planted the same number each day, this sounds like a division problem. I think I need to divide the total number of seeds by the number of days to find out how many seeds per day.\n\nLet me write that down: 225 seeds divided by 5 days. So, 225 ÷ 5. Hmm, let me do this calculation step by step to make sure I get it right.\n\nFirst, I know that 5 times 40 is 200. So, 225 minus 200 is 25. Then, I have 25 seeds left. How many times does 5 go into 25? That's 5 times. So, adding that to the 40, I get 45. So, 5 times 45 is 225. That makes sense because 45 times 5 is 225. \n\nWait, let me double-check that. 45 times 5: 40 times 5 is 200, and 5 times 5 is 25, so 200 plus 25 is 225.

{"id":1371,"question":"A company was buying new uniforms for its employees. They bought 121 uniforms total for their 32 stores. About how many uniforms should each store get?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so the company bought 121 uniforms for 32 stores and wants to know how many uniforms each store should get. First, I need to figure out how to distribute 121 uniforms evenly among 32 stores.\n\nI think I should divide the total number of uniforms by the number of stores. So, 121 divided by 32. Let me do that calculation. 121 ÷ 32 is approximately 3.78125. Hmm, that's more than 3 but less than 4. Since we can't have a fraction of a uniform, I guess we need to round this number.\n\nThe question says \"about how many,\" so I think rounding to the nearest whole number makes sense. 3.78125 is closer to 4 than to 3, so maybe we should round up to 4. But wait, I should check if there's a way to distribute them so that some stores get 3 and others get 4. If I multiply 32 by 4, that gives me 128 uniforms, which is more than the 121 they actually bought. That means some stores will have to get fewer uniforms.\n\nSo, 32 stores times 3 uniforms each would be 96 uniforms. Subtract that from 121, and we have 25 uniforms left.

{"id":1415,"question":"A classroom had 35 glue sticks. If the ratio of glue sticks to glue bottles was 5:2, how many glue bottles did the classroom have?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I need to figure out how many glue bottles are in the classroom. The problem says there are 35 glue sticks, and the ratio of glue sticks to glue bottles is 5:2. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that ratios compare quantities. Here, 5 parts glue sticks to 2 parts glue bottles. That means for every 5 glue sticks, there are 2 glue bottles. \n\nI think I can set up a proportion to solve this. If 5 parts correspond to 35 glue sticks, then 1 part would correspond to 35 divided by 5. Let me calculate that: 35 divided by 5 is 7. So, each part is equal to 7.\n\nNow, since the ratio says there are 2 parts of glue bottles, I can multiply 7 by 2 to find the number of glue bottles. 7 times 2 is 14. So, there should be 14 glue bottles.\n\nLet me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If there are 14 glue bottles and 7 glue sticks per part, then the total parts would be 5 + 2 = 7 parts. Each part is 7, so 7 parts would be 7 times 7, which is 49. Wait, that doesn't add up because the total number of glue sticks is 35, not 49. Hmm, I think I messed up the parts.\n\nWait, no, actually, the total number of glue sticks is 35, which is 5 parts. So each part is 7, and the total number of glue bottles is 2 parts, which is 14. But if I add 35 glue sticks and 14 glue bottles, that's 49 items total, which doesn't make sense because the problem doesn't specify anything about the total number of items. So maybe I shouldn't be adding them. Instead, the ratio is just between glue sticks and glue bottles, so I should just focus on the parts.\n\nSo, if 5 parts are glue sticks and 2 parts are glue bottles, and 5 parts equal 35 glue sticks, then each part is 7. Therefore, 2 parts of glue bottles would be 14. That seems correct because 14 glue bottles and 35 glue sticks have a ratio of 5:2. Let me confirm: 35 divided by 5 is 7, and 14 divided by 2 is 7.

The problem says he spent 63 minutes walking, and the ratio of his walking time to jogging time was 9:1. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the ratio 9:1 means for every 9 minutes he walked, he spent 1 minute jogging. That makes sense because walking is slower than jogging, so more time was spent on walking. \n\nGiven that he walked for 63 minutes, I can set up a proportion to find out how much time he spent jogging. If 9 minutes of walking correspond to 1 minute of jogging, then 63 minutes of walking would correspond to X minutes of jogging. \n\nSo, I can write the proportion as 9/1 = 63/X.

This can be written as a fraction, sugar divided by flour, which equals 10/1. So, sugar/flower = 10/1.\n\nI have 50 ounces of sugar, and I need to find out how many ounces of flour that corresponds to. Let me denote the amount of flour needed as F. So, 50 ounces of sugar corresponds to F ounces of flour.\n\nUsing the ratio, I can set up the equation: 50 / F = 10 / 1.\n\nTo solve for F, I can cross-multiply. That gives me 10 * F = 50 * 1, which simplifies to 10F = 50.\n\nNext, I'll solve for F by dividing both sides of the equation by 10. So, F = 50 / 10, which equals 5.\n\nTherefore, if I use 50 ounces of sugar, I would need 5 ounces of flour to maintain the 10:1 ratio.","full_output":"Okay, so I need to solve this math word problem.

Now, there are four tables available. So, if each table can seat eight people, then for four tables, the total number of people that can be seated would be the product of the number of tables and the number of people each table can seat. \n\nLet me write this out to make it clearer.

So, I'm ready to present the final answer.","full_output":"Okay, so I have this problem where a vet is weighing three cats, and I need to find their combined weight. Let me break it down step by step to make sure I understand everything correctly.\n\nFirst, I'll list out the weights of each cat individually. The first cat weighs 2 pounds, the second cat weighs 7 pounds, and the third cat weighs 4 pounds. So, I have three numbers: 2, 7, and 4.\n\nNow, I need to add these weights together to find the total combined weight. Let me start by adding the first two weights: 2 pounds and 7 pounds. If I add those together, I get 2 + 7, which equals 9 pounds. Okay, that's straightforward.\n\nNext, I need to add the weight of the third cat to this total. The third cat weighs 4 pounds, so I'll add that to the previous total. That means I take 9 pounds and add 4 pounds to it. So, 9 + 4 equals 13 pounds. \n\nWait, let me double-check my addition to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I added 2 and 7 first, getting 9, and then added 4 to that, resulting in 13. That seems correct. I don't think I missed anything here.\n\nJust to be thorough, I'll write down the addition process again:\n\n2 (first cat)\n+7 (second cat)\n=9\n\nThen,\n\n9 (total after first two cats)\n+4 (third cat)\n=13\n\nYep, that checks out. So, the combined weight of all three cats is 13 pounds.\n\nI don't think I need to consider any other factors here, like maybe the cats' ages or anything else, because the problem only asks for their combined weight. So, I'm confident that 13 pounds is the right answer.\n\nWait a second, let me make sure I didn't misread the question. It says the first cat weighed 2 pounds, the second 7 pounds, and the third 4 pounds. Yep, that's what I used. So, no issues there.\n\nI think that's all.

{"id":1743,"question":"Hay's Linens sells hand towels in sets of 17 and bath towels in sets of 6. If the store sold the same number of each this morning, what is the smallest number of each type of towel that the store must have sold?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Hay's Linens sells hand towels in sets of 17 and bath towels in sets of 6. They sold the same number of each today. I need to find the smallest number of each type of towel that the store must have sold. \n\nHmm, so if they sold the same number of hand towels and bath towels, let's say they sold 'n' sets of each. That means the total number of hand towels sold would be 17 times n, and the total number of bath towels sold would be 6 times n. \n\nSo, the total hand towels sold = 17n, and the total bath towels sold = 6n. I need to find the smallest n such that both 17n and 6n are integers because you can't sell a fraction of a towel. But wait, n has to be an integer because you can't sell a fraction of a set. So, n must be a positive integer.\n\nBut actually, the problem is asking for the smallest number of each type of towel that the store must have sold. So, I think it's referring to the smallest number of sets sold, which would be the least common multiple (LCM) of 17 and 6. \n\nWait, let me think again. The total number of hand towels sold is 17n and bath towels sold is 6n. The smallest number of each type sold would be the smallest n such that both 17n and 6n are whole numbers, which they always are since n is an integer. But maybe they want the smallest total number of towels sold, which would be when n is the smallest positive integer, which is 1. But that would mean 17 hand towels and 6 bath towels, which is possible. \n\nBut maybe they want the smallest number of each type, meaning the smallest number of sets sold such that both 17n and 6n are the same number. That would be when 17n = 6n, but that only happens when n=0, which isn't practical. So, perhaps the smallest number of each type sold is the least common multiple of 17 and 6, which is 102. So, they sold 102 sets of each, which is 102 hand towels and 102 bath towels.\n\nWait, but that seems too large. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me try a different approach. The total number of hand towels sold is 17n and bath towels is 6n. Since they sold the same number, 17n = 6n. But that only makes sense if n=0, which isn't possible. So, maybe the question is asking for the smallest number of each type of towel sold, meaning the smallest n where both 17n and 6n are integers. Since n is an integer, the smallest n is 1, so 17 hand towels and 6 bath towels.\n\nBut that seems too small. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the smallest number of each type of towel that must have been sold, meaning the least common multiple of 17 and 6. The LCM of 17 and 6 is 102, so they sold 102 sets of each, which is 17*102 = 1734 hand towels and 6*102 = 612 bath towels. That seems like a lot, but it's the smallest number where both 17n and 6n are integers.\n\nWait, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should check if there's a smaller number. Let's see, 17 and 6 are coprime, meaning their LCM is just 17*6=102. So, the smallest number of sets sold is 102, resulting in 1734 hand towels and 612 bath towels. That's the smallest number where both 17n and 6n are integers, and n is the same for both.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is asking for the smallest number of each type sold, meaning the smallest number of towels, which would be when n=1, resulting in 17 hand towels and 6 bath towels. But that seems too small.\n\nI think the correct approach is to find the least common multiple of 17 and 6, which is 102, so the store must have sold 102 sets of each, resulting in 1734 hand towels and 612 bath towels. Therefore, the smallest number of each type sold is 102 sets, but since the question asks for the number of towels, not sets, it's 1734 hand towels and 612 bath towels.\n\nWait, but the question says \"the smallest number of each type of towel,\" so it might be referring to the number of towels, not sets.

Both Sam and Carlos are bowling, and each time they bowl, they knock down a certain number of pins. Sam scores 8 pins each time, and Carlos scores 9 pins each time.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know there are 32 forwards and 80 guards in the league. Leo wants to form teams where each team has the same number of forwards and guards. To maximize the number of teams, I should find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the number of forwards and guards. The GCD will tell me the largest number of teams possible, and then I can divide the number of guards by this GCD to find out how many guards per team.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD. One method is the Euclidean algorithm. I'll apply that here.\n\nStarting with 80 guards and 32 forwards:\n\n1. Divide 80 by 32. 32 goes into 80 two times with a remainder. 2 times 32 is 64, and 80 minus 64 is 16. So, the remainder is 16.\n2. Now, take the divisor (32) and divide it by the remainder (16). 16 goes into 32 exactly two times with no remainder.\n\nSince the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is 16, which is the GCD.\n\nSo, the greatest number of teams Leo can create is 16. Now, to find out how many guards each team will have, I divide the total number of guards by the number of teams.\n\n80 guards divided by 16 teams equals 5 guards per team.\n\nI should double-check my work to ensure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me verify:\n\n- 16 teams * 32 forwards per team = 512 forwards. Wait, that doesn't make sense because there are only 32 forwards in total. I must have made a mistake here.\n\nOh no, I see the error. I confused the GCD with the number of teams. Wait, the GCD is 16, which is the number of teams. So, 16 teams * 32 forwards = 512 forwards, which is way more than the 32 forwards available. That can't be right.\n\nI think I messed up the initial step.

That means we need to find a number that can divide both the number of girls and boys evenly. This sounds like finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, 25 and 35.\n\nLet me recall how to find the GCD. One way is to list all the divisors of each number and find the largest one they have in common. So, let's list the divisors of 25 and 35.\n\nDivisors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25 because 25 divided by 1 is 25, 25 divided by 5 is 5, and 25 divided by 25 is 1.\n\nDivisors of 35 are 1, 5, and 35 because 35 divided by 1 is 35, 35 divided by 5 is 7, and 35 divided by 35 is 1.\n\nNow, looking at the common divisors between 25 and 35, they are 1 and 5.

Both numbers have 2 as a common prime factor. The lowest exponent of 2 in the factorizations is 2^4 (since 48 has 2^4 and 32 has 2^5).\n\nTherefore, the GCD is 2^4, which is 16.\n\nSo, The Khan Corporation can donate to 16 schools, with each school receiving 48/16 = 3 computers and 32/16 = 2 printers.\n</think>\n\nThe Khan Corporation can donate to 16 schools with each school receiving 3 computers and 2 printers.

So, in this case, I need to find the LCM of 9 and 15.\n\nTo find the LCM, I can break down each number into its prime factors. For 9, the prime factors are 3 and 3, so that's 3². For 15, the prime factors are 3 and 5, so that's 3¹ × 5¹. \n\nThe LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime number that appears in the factorization of either number. So, for 3, the highest power is 3² from 9, and for 5, it's 5¹ from 15. Multiplying these together gives me 3² × 5¹ = 9 × 5 = 45.\n\nTherefore, the two signs will blink together again after 45 seconds.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{45}","ground_truth":"45","predicted_answer":"45","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

If Samuel gave equal numbers of Skittles to his 4 friends and then he ate what was left, how many Skittles did each person eat?\"\n\nSo, each person includes himself? So, each of the 4 friends and Samuel. So, each person ate 3 Skittles to their friend and 1 to themselves? Wait, that can't be right because 3 to their friend and 1 to themselves would be 4, but Samuel only had 14.\n\nWait, no, perhaps each person ate 3 Skittles in total, either to their friend or to themselves. So, each person ate 3 Skittles, and since he had 14, he gave 3 to each of his 4 friends, totaling 12, and then he ate the remaining 2. So, each person ate 3 Skittles in total.\n\nWait, but the question says \"how many Skittles did each person eat?\" So, each person ate 3 to their friend and 1 to themselves? Wait, no, that would be 4 each, which is more than 14.\n\nWait, I think I'm overcomplicating it. Let me try again.\n\nTotal Skittles: 14.\n\nNumber of friends: 4.\n\nHe gives equal numbers to each friend. So, 14 divided by 4 is 3.5. But since you can't give half a Skittle, maybe it's 3 each, which would be 12 given out, leaving 2. So, each friend gets 3, and Samuel gets 2. So, each person (friends and himself) ate 3 to their friend and 1 to themselves? Wait, no, that would be 4 each, which is 16, but he only had 14.\n\nWait, no, maybe each person (including himself) ate 3 Skittles, but that would be 12, and he has 2 left, so he can't eat more. So, perhaps he gives 3 to each friend and eats 2 himself, so each person ate 3, and he ate 2. But the question is asking how many each person ate, so maybe each person ate 3, including himself.\n\nWait, but Samuel has 14, gives 3 to each of 4 friends, which is 12, and eats 2 himself. So, each person (friend and Samuel) ate 3 to their friend and 1 to themselves? Wait, that's not possible because 3+1=4, and 4*4=16, which is more than 14.\n\nWait, maybe each person ate 3 to their friend, and the 2 he ate was separate. So, each friend ate 3, and Samuel ate 2, but the question is asking how many each person ate. So, each person ate 3 to their friend and 1 to themselves? Wait, that would be 4 each, which is 16, but he only had 14.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to structure it.\n\nTotal Skittles: 14.\n\nNumber of friends: 4.\n\nEach friend gets x Skittles.\n\nHe eats y Skittles.\n\nSo, 4x + y = 14.\n\nHe wants to give equal numbers to each friend, so x must be the same for each.\n\nSince 14 divided by 4 is 3.5, but you can't split Skittles, so maybe he gives 3 to each friend, which is 12, leaving 2. So, each friend gets 3, and he eats 2.\n\nSo, each person (friend and himself) ate 3 to their friend and 1 to themselves? Wait, that's not possible because 3+1=4, and 4*4=16, which is more than 14.\n\nWait, maybe each person ate 3, and the remaining 2 are separate. So, each person ate 3, and Samuel ate 2. So, in total, each person ate 3, and Samuel ate 2. So, each person ate 3.\n\nBut the question is asking how many Skittles did each person eat. So, each person (friend and Samuel) ate 3. So, the answer is 3.\n\nWait, but Samuel only ate 2. So, maybe the answer is that each person ate 3, and Samuel ate 2. But the question is asking how many each person ate, so perhaps the answer is 3, as each person ate 3.\n\nWait, but Samuel ate 2, so maybe the answer is 3 for each person, and Samuel ate 2 separately.
