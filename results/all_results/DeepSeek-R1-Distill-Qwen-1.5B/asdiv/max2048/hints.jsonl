To solve this, I can try different values of L and see if 134 - 15L is divisible by 7, since 134 - 15L must be a multiple of 7 to use only small trucks for the remaining load.\n\nLet's start with L = 0: 134 - 0 = 134. 134 divided by 7 is approximately 19.14, which isn't an integer. So, no solution here.\n\nNext, L = 1: 134 - 15 = 119. 119 divided by 7 is 17. That's an integer. So, S = 17. Total trucks used would be 1 + 17 = 18.\n\nLet me check if there's a smaller number of trucks. Let's try L = 2: 134 - 30 = 104. 104 divided by 7 is about 14.857, not an integer.\n\nL = 3: 134 - 45 = 89. 89 divided by 7 is approximately 12.714, not an integer.\n\nL = 4: 134 - 60 = 74. 74 divided by 7 is approximately 10.571, not an integer.\n\nL = 5: 134 - 75 = 59. 59 divided by 7 is about 8.428, not an integer.\n\nL = 6: 134 - 90 = 44. 44 divided by 7 is approximately 6.285, not an integer.\n\nL = 7: 134 - 105 = 29. 29 divided by 7 is about 4.142, not an integer.\n\nL = 8: 134 - 120 = 14. 14 divided by 7 is 2. That's an integer. So, S = 2. Total trucks used would be 8 + 2 = 10.\n\nWait, that's fewer than the previous 18 trucks. So, 10 trucks in total. Let me confirm:\n\nLarge trucks: 8 * 15 = 120 tons\nSmall trucks: 2 * 7 = 14 tons\nTotal: 120 + 14 = 134 tons\n\nYes, that adds up correctly. So, Mr. Lee can use 8 large trucks and 2 small trucks to carry all the fruits with the least number of trucks.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{10}","ground_truth":"2","predicted_answer":"10","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false,"hint_sentence":"Mr. Lee needs to load exactly 134 tons using large and small trucks.

{"id":771,"question":"Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon. If each piece was 73 cm long, how much of the original ribbon was left?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I have this problem where Sam cut equal-length pieces of ribbon from a 3,730-cm long ribbon. Each piece is 73 cm long. I need to find out how much ribbon is left after cutting as many equal pieces as possible. Hmm, let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that to find the total length of ribbon used, I can multiply the number of pieces by the length of each piece. But I don't know how many pieces Sam cut. Maybe I can find that by dividing the total length by the length of each piece. So, 3,730 cm divided by 73 cm per piece.\n\nLet me do that division: 3,730 ÷ 73. I'm not sure exactly how many times 73 goes into 3,730, but I can estimate. 73 times 50 is 3,650. That's close to 3,730. Subtracting 3,650 from 3,730 gives me 80. So, 50 pieces would use 3,650 cm, leaving 80 cm. But 80 cm isn't enough for another full piece of 73 cm because 73 cm is less than 80 cm. So, Sam can only cut 50 pieces of 73 cm each.\n\nNow, to find out how much ribbon is left, I subtract the total length used from the original length. That would be 3,730 cm minus (50 pieces × 73 cm). I already know that 50 × 73 is 3,650 cm. So, 3,730 - 3,650 = 80 cm.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If each piece is 73 cm and Sam cuts 50 pieces, that's 50 × 73 = 3,650 cm.

In order to make the least number of groups, how many small groups should be made?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how to divide 90 students into groups of 7 and 3 to make the least number of groups possible. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that the total number of students is 90. The goal is to divide them into two types of groups: large groups with 7 members each and small groups with 3 members each. The aim is to minimize the total number of groups. \n\nI think I should start by figuring out how many small groups I can make if I only use the small groups. If each small group has 3 students, then the number of small groups would be 90 divided by 3. Let me calculate that: 90 ÷ 3 = 30. So, if I make only small groups, I would have 30 groups in total.\n\nBut wait, the problem allows me to use both large and small groups. Maybe using some large groups can reduce the total number of groups. I should explore that possibility.\n\nLet me denote the number of large groups as L and the number of small groups as S. The total number of students can be represented by the equation:\n\n7L + 3S = 90\n\nMy goal is to minimize the total number of groups, which is L + S. To minimize L + S, I need to find values of L and S that satisfy the equation while keeping their sum as small as possible.\n\nI can start by expressing one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for S:\n\n3S = 90 - 7L\nS = (90 - 7L) / 3\n\nSince S must be an integer, (90 - 7L) must be divisible by 3. Let's see what values of L will make this true.\n\n7L modulo 3 should be equal to 90 modulo 3. Since 90 is divisible by 3, 7L must also be congruent to 0 modulo 3. But 7 is congruent to 1 modulo 3, so this simplifies to L ≡ 0 modulo 3. Therefore, L must be a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's try L = 0: Then S = (90 - 0)/3 = 30. So total groups = 0 + 30 = 30.\n\nNext, L = 3: Then S = (90 - 21)/3 = 69/3 = 23. Total groups = 3 + 23 = 26.\n\nL = 6: S = (90 - 42)/3 = 48/3 = 16. Total groups = 6 + 16 = 22.\n\nL = 9: S = (90 - 63)/3 = 27/3 = 9. Total groups = 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nL = 12: S = (90 - 84)/3 = 6/3 = 2. Total groups = 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nL = 15: S = (90 - 105)/3. Wait, 90 - 105 is negative, which isn't possible. So, L can't be 15 or higher because that would make S negative, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo, the minimum number of groups occurs when L = 12 and S = 2, giving a total of 14 groups.\n\nLet me double-check to ensure I haven't missed any other combinations. The next multiple of 3 after 12 is 15, which we've already considered and found to be invalid. So, 12 large groups and 2 small groups give the least number of groups, totaling 14.\n\nTherefore, the least number of groups is 14.","full_output":"Okay, so I've got this math problem here, and I need to figure out how to divide 90 students into groups of 7 and 3 to make the least number of groups possible.

The aim is to minimize the total number of groups. \n\nI think I should start by figuring out how many small groups I can make if I only use the small groups. If each small group has 3 students, then the number of small groups would be 90 divided by 3. Let me calculate that: 90 ÷ 3 = 30. So, if I make only small groups, I would have 30 groups in total.\n\nBut wait, the problem allows me to use both large and small groups. Maybe using some large groups can reduce the total number of groups. I should explore that possibility.\n\nLet me denote the number of large groups as L and the number of small groups as S. The total number of students can be represented by the equation:\n\n7L + 3S = 90\n\nMy goal is to minimize the total number of groups, which is L + S. To minimize L + S, I need to find values of L and S that satisfy the equation while keeping their sum as small as possible.\n\nI can start by expressing one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for S:\n\n3S = 90 - 7L\nS = (90 - 7L) / 3\n\nSince S must be an integer, (90 - 7L) must be divisible by 3. Let's see what values of L will make this true.\n\n7L modulo 3 should be equal to 90 modulo 3. Since 90 is divisible by 3, 7L must also be congruent to 0 modulo 3. But 7 is congruent to 1 modulo 3, so this simplifies to L ≡ 0 modulo 3. Therefore, L must be a multiple of 3.\n\nLet's try L = 0: Then S = (90 - 0)/3 = 30. So total groups = 0 + 30 = 30.\n\nNext, L = 3: Then S = (90 - 21)/3 = 69/3 = 23. Total groups = 3 + 23 = 26.\n\nL = 6: S = (90 - 42)/3 = 48/3 = 16. Total groups = 6 + 16 = 22.\n\nL = 9: S = (90 - 63)/3 = 27/3 = 9. Total groups = 9 + 9 = 18.\n\nL = 12: S = (90 - 84)/3 = 6/3 = 2. Total groups = 12 + 2 = 14.\n\nL = 15: S = (90 - 105)/3. Wait, 90 - 105 is negative, which isn't possible. So, L can't be 15 or higher because that would make S negative, which isn't allowed.\n\nSo, the minimum number of groups occurs when L = 12 and S = 2, giving a total of 14 groups.\n\nLet me double-check to ensure I haven't missed any other combinations. The next multiple of 3 after 12 is 15, which we've already considered and found to be invalid. So, 12 large groups and 2 small groups give the least number of groups, totaling 14.\n\nTherefore, the least number of groups is 14.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{14}","ground_truth":"2","predicted_answer":"14","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false,"hint_sentence":"Understanding that the total number of students (90) must be accounted for in the combination of group sizes, especially when mixing different group sizes. Sometimes, you might need to adjust the number of smaller groups when you can't perfectly divide the total number by the larger group size."}

To find out how many rabbits each cage will have, I should divide the total number of rabbits by the number of cages.\n\nSo, I'll perform the division: 164 ÷ 17. Let me calculate that. 17 times 9 is 153, and 164 minus 153 leaves 11. So, 164 ÷ 17 equals 9 with a remainder of 11.

{"id":840,"question":"A worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep. It climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day. How many days will it take the worm to reach the top?","chain_of_thought":"Okay, so I have this problem where a worm is trying to climb out of a 26-inch deep hole. Each day, the worm climbs up 8 inches but then slides back 3 inches. I need to figure out how many days it will take for the worm to get out of the hole.\n\nFirst, I'll try to understand the situation. Every day, the worm makes a net progress. It climbs 8 inches and then slides back 3 inches. So, the net gain per day is 8 - 3 = 5 inches. That means each day, the worm is effectively moving up 5 inches.\n\nBut wait, on the last day, when the worm reaches or exceeds the top of the hole, it doesn't slide back. So, I need to consider that on the final day, it might climb out without sliding back. That means I have to calculate how many days it takes for the worm to reach just below the top, and then on the next day, it climbs out.\n\nLet me break it down. The hole is 26 inches deep. Each day, the worm's net progress is 5 inches. If I divide the total depth by the net progress per day, I get 26 / 5 = 5.2 days. Since the worm can't climb a fraction of a day, I'll round up to 6 days.

We need to find the father's current age.\n\nFirst, let's define some variables to make this easier. Let's say the father's current age is F, and the total age of all five children together is C. According to the problem, F is equal to C. So, we can write that as:\n\nF = C\n\nNow, after 15 years, each child will be 15 years older. Since there are five children, the total increase in their combined ages will be 5 times 15, which is 75 years.

If the father is 45, then the total age of the children is also 45. After 15 years, each child will be 15 years older, so the total increase is 75 years. Therefore, the children's total age will be 45 + 75 = 120 years. The father's age in 15 years will be 45 + 15 = 60 years. Is 120 equal to twice 60? Yes, because 2 * 60 = 120.

To find out how much goes into each glass, I should perform a division.\n\nSo, I'll take the total pints, which is 153, and divide it by the number of glasses, which is 5. That means I need to calculate 153 divided by 5.\n\nLet me do the division: 153 ÷ 5. I know that 5 goes into 15 three times, so I write down 3. Then, subtract 15 from 15, which leaves me with 0. Bring down the next digit, which is 3. Now, 5 goes into 3 zero times, so I write a 0. Subtract 0 from 3, which leaves 3. Bring down the next digit, which is 0, making it 30. 5 goes into 30 six times, so I write down 6. Subtract 30 from 30, which leaves 0.

We need to find out how many Starbursts each friend gets and how many he eats.\n\nFirst, I'll figure out how many Starbursts each friend gets.
