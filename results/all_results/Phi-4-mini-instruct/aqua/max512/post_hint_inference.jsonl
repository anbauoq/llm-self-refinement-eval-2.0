Since Jack buys a total of 18 sharpeners, we have W + B = 18. Let the cost of a brown sharpener be x rupees. Then, the cost of a white sharpener is x + 1 rupees. The total cost equation is W(x + 1) + Bx = 100. Substituting B = 18 - W into the total cost equation gives us W(x + 1) + (18 - W)x = 100, which simplifies to Wx + W + 18x - Wx = 100, and further simplifies to W + 18x = 100. We need to find integer solutions for W and x such that W + 18x = 100 and W + B = 18.

The diameter of each semi-circle is 20 cm, so the radius is 10 cm. The area of one semi-circle is (1/2) * π * r² = (1/2) * π * (10 cm)² = 50π cm². Since there are two semi-circles, their combined area is 2 * 50π cm² = 100π cm². The area of the remaining paper is the area of the square minus the combined area of the semi-circles: 400 cm² - 100π cm². Using π ≈ 3.14, the combined area of the semi-circles is approximately 100 * 3.14 = 314 cm². Therefore, the remaining area is 400 cm² - 314 cm² = 86 cm². The correct option is not listed, so I will calculate again.\n\nRe-evaluating, the area of one semi-circle is (1/2) * π * (10 cm)² = 50π cm², and for two semi-circles, it's 100π cm². Using π ≈ 3.14, 100π cm² ≈ 314 cm², and the remaining area is indeed 400 cm² - 314 cm² = 86 cm².

The height of the room is:\n\nOptions:\nA)2.6m\nB)3.9m\nC)4m\nD)4.2m\nE)4.4m","chain_of_thought":"Given the semi-perimeter to height ratio of 2:5 and the cost of papering the room, we first need to calculate the total wall area that needs to be covered. The cost to cover this area is Rs.260, with paper costing Rs.2 per meter, and each meter has a width of 0.5 meters, meaning 2 meters of paper covers 1 square meter. Hence, 260 / 2 = 130 meters of paper is used, and therefore 130 square meters are covered.\n\nNext, we subtract the area for doors and windows (15 square meters), leaving 130 - 15 = 115 square meters to be covered with paper.\n\nNow, we need to find the total wall area of the room, which includes all four walls. The semi-perimeter is the sum of half the lengths of all four walls, and the area of the walls can be calculated using the height (h) and semi-perimeter (s). Since the semi-perimeter to height ratio is 5:2, we can express the height as h = (2/5)s. The total wall area is then 2h * s = 2 * (2/5)s^2 = (4/5)s^2.\n\nSetting (4/5)s^2 equal to 115 square meters (the area to be covered), we can solve for s (the semi-perimeter). Once we have s, we can find the height h using the ratio h = (2/5)s. This will give us the height of the room.\n\nSolving the equation (4/5)s^2 = 115 for s, we get s^2 = (115 * 5) / 4, which simplifies to s^2 = 143.75. Taking the square root gives us s = √143.75 ≈ 11.99 meters. Now, using the ratio to find the height, h = (2/5) * 11.99 ≈ 4.796 meters, which we round to the nearest tenth to get approximately 4.8 meters. However, none of the options are exactly 4.8 meters, so we need to choose the closest one, which is 4.4 meters (option E).","full_output":"<think>Given the semi-perimeter to height ratio of 2:5 and the cost of papering the room, we first need to calculate the total wall area that needs to be covered.

Allen's speed is 54 kmph and Bob's speed is 78 kmph. Bob covers 48 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time.
