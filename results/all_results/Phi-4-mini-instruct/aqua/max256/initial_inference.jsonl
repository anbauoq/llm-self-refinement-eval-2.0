We are given the area of the rectangle as 150 square meters.\n2. We are told that the length (L) is 1 meter more than 4 times the breadth (B). So, L = 4B + 1.\n3. The area of a rectangle is given by the product of its length and breadth: A = L * B. Substituting the given values, we get 150 = (4B + 1) * B.\n4. This simplifies to the quadratic equation: 4B^2 + B - 150 = 0.\n5. Solving this quadratic equation for B, we find that B = 6 (since the breadth cannot be negative).\n6. Substituting B back into the equation for L, we find L = 4*6 + 1 = 25.\n7. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by P = 2(L","full_output":"<think>Let the breadth of the rectangle be B meters. Then, the length L is given by L = 4B + 1. The area of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and breadth: L * B = 150. Substituting the expression for L, we get (4B + 1) * B = 150. This simplifies to 4B^2 + B = 150. Rearranging gives 4B^2 + B - 150 = 0. Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula B = [-1 ± sqrt(1 + 4*4*150)] / 8. Simplifying inside the square root gives B = [-1 ± sqrt(2401)] / 8. Since B must be positive, we take the positive root: B = [-1 + 49] / 8 = 48 / 8 = 6. So, the breadth B is 6 meters. The length L is 4*6 + 1 = 25 meters. The perimeter P of the rectangle is given by P = 2(L + B) = 2(25 + 6) = 2*31 = 62 meters.

If the book was sold for Rs 27.50 with a 10% profit, then 110% of the cost price equals Rs 27.50. Let's denote the cost price as CP. So, 1.10 * CP = 27.50. Solving for CP gives us CP = 27.50 / 1.10 = Rs 25. So the cost price is Rs 25.\n\nNext, we need to determine the profit or loss when the book is sold for Rs 25.75. Since the selling price (SP) of Rs 25.75 is less than the cost price (CP) of Rs 25, there is a loss. The loss is calculated as CP - SP, which is 25 - 25.75 = -0.75. To find the percentage of loss, we use the formula: (Loss / CP) * 100 = (-0.75 / 25) * 100 = -3%.

They lost 30% of their matches. Let the total number of matches be T. The number of matches lost is 0.3T. Since they won 20 matches, they played a total of 20 + 0.3T matches. This total matches the sum of wins and losses, so 20 + 0.3T = T. Solving for T, we get 0.7T = 20, so T = 20 / 0.7 ≈ 28.57, which means the number of matches lost is 0.3 * 29 ≈ 8.7, rounding to the nearest whole number gives 9. So the team lost 9 matches, which is not an option. We must have made an error in rounding or assumptions, so let's try a different approach. Since 30% of the matches lost equals 30% of T, and we know the wins are 20, T must be such that 0.3T is a multiple of 10 (since 30% is 10/100).

Next, find the total distance the train needs to travel to completely pass through the tunnel. This includes the length of the tunnel plus the length of the train itself. Given that it takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, the train covers 3 * (1/30) = 1/10 miles in 3 seconds. Since the train is 1/10 miles long, the total distance it must travel to pass through completely is the length of the tunnel (1 mile) plus the length of the train (1/10 miles), which is 1 + 1/10 = 11/10 miles. Now, calculate the time required to travel this distance at the train's speed: (11/10) miles / (1/30) miles per second = (11/10) * 30 = 33 seconds. Therefore, the train will take 33 seconds to completely pass through the tunnel.</think>\n<ans>D</ans>","ground_truth":"D","predicted_answer":"D","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}

The correct answer to the question provided is not option E (80 kmph), as previously stated. Let's correct this:\n\nThe car initially travels at 60 km/hr and needs to cover the same distance in half the time (10 hours instead of 20 hours), which means the speed must double. Therefore, the gain in speed is 60 km/hr (from 60 km/hr to 120 km/hr). The correct answer that represents the speed gained is 60 km/hr, but since this option is not available, there seems to be a mistake in the provided options or in the interpretation of the question.

New Speed = Distance / Time = 1200 km / 10 hr = 120 km/hr.\nThe gain in speed is the difference between the new speed and the original speed: Gain in Speed = 120 km/hr - 60 km/hr = 60 km/hr.\nHowever, the question asks for the speed gained, which is the new speed (120 km/hr) minus the original speed (60 km/hr), resulting in a gain of 60 km/hr.

We know the average score of the passing students is 83, and the average score of the failing students is 55. The overall average score of the class is 76.\n\nThe total score of the passing students is 83P, and the total score of the failing students is 55F. The overall total score is 76(P + F).\n\nUsing the equation for the overall average, we have:\n\n83P + 55F = 76(P + F)\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n83P + 55F = 76P + 76F\n7P = 21F\nP/F = 3/1\n\nThis means for every 3 passing students, there is 1 failing student. The total number of students is P + F.\n\nThe fraction of passing students is P / (P + F). Since P = 3F, we have:\n\nP / (P + F) = 3F / (3F + F) = 3F / 4F = 3/4 = 0.75\n\nConverting this fraction to a percentage, we get 75%.\n\nThe correct\n\n<ans>E</ans>The following question has been scrambled and some parts have been removed.
