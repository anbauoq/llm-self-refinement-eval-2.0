According to the given ratio, 2/h = 5/p, which simplifies to h = (2/5) * p or p = (5/2) * h. The total area to be papered is the perimeter multiplied by the height minus the area for doors and windows. So, the area to be papered is p * h - 15. The width of the paper is 0.5 meters, so the length of paper required is the area to be papered divided by the width: (p * h - 15) / 0.5. The cost of papering is the length of paper multiplied by the cost per meter, which is Rs.2. So, the equation becomes 2 * (p * h - 15) / 0.5 = 260.

The 6 children between them now tell you that there are 6 + 4 + 14 = 24 positions between them, plus the two of them at the ends, making 26 positions in total.
