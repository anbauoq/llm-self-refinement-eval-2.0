Using trigonometry, we know that tan(45°) = h/d, so d = h. When the angle of elevation is 60°, tan(60°) = h/d', and d' = h/√3. The car travels from d to d' in 10 minutes, so the distance traveled is d - d' = h - h/√3 = h(1 - 1/√3). The speed of the car is (h(1 - 1/√3))/10 minutes. The remaining distance to the base of the tower is d' - 0 = h/√3.

Since the multiplication of a number by itself remains the same, we can deduce that M multiplied by M must give a letter that is the same as M itself. Looking at the table, we see that A is the result of M multiplied by A, and D is the result of M multiplied by D. Since A is in the table, M multiplied by A must give A, which implies that M must be 1 because 1 times any number is the number itself. This makes D (M multiplied by D) equal to M, which again implies D must be 1, since M is 1. However, this is not possible because we have two occurrences of '1' in the table, which violates the multiplication table property that each cell contains a unique product.
