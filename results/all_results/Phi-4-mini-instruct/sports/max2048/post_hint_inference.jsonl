State the final answer in the exact format: `Answer: <Yes/No>`\n\nQuestion: Is the following sentence plausible? Luke Voit was out at first\nPlease provide a step-by-step breakdown and end with your final answer. You can provide evidence from the text, but that is not necessary. Your final output should be only \"Answer: Yes/No\" on a separate line. Luke Voit is a professional baseball player, which implies he plays in Major League Baseball (MLB). Players in MLB can be out of the game for various reasons such as injuries, rest, or other circumstances. The phrase \"out at first\" typically refers to a player being unable to participate in a game, possibly due to being injured or not being ready to play.\n\nHowever, without additional context or specific details about the timeframe or reason, it is challenging to determine the plausibility of the statement. The statement is plausible in the sense that any professional athlete could be out of a game for the first time, but without more information, we cannot definitively confirm its accuracy.\n\nAnswer: Yes","ground_truth":"1","predicted_answer":"0","is_correct":false}
