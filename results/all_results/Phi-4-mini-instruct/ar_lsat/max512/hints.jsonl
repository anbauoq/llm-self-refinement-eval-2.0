We must choose one more botanist or chemist to meet the requirement of having at least one of each type. Since we have already selected one botanist (F), we cannot select another botanist because if we did, we would violate the rule that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected (we already have two zoologists Q and R). Therefore, we must choose one more chemist. We cannot choose K because F and K cannot both be selected, and we already have F.

This means wall 1 has both Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor. Wall 1 cannot have Isaacs's oil because of condition 3. Wall 4 has Isaacs's oil in the lower position, so wall 4 cannot have Isaacs's watercolor in the upper position.\n\nNow we need to place Isaacs's watercolor. Since wall 1 has both Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor, and wall 4 has Isaacs's oil in the lower position, Isaacs's watercolor must be on either wall 2 or wall 3. Wall 1 is now occupied by two students, so wall 2 or wall 3 must have Isaacs's watercolor.\n\nFranz's watercolor cannot be on wall 4 because Isaacs's watercolor must be on walls 2 or 3. Franz's watercolor must be on wall 2 or wall 3.

Since no wall can have only one student's work, wall 2 or wall 3 must have both Isaacs's watercolor and another student's painting.\n\nWall 1 already has Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor. Therefore, Franz's watercolor must be on walls 2, 3, or 4. Since wall 4 already has Isaacs's oil, it can't have both Isaacs's watercolor and another student's painting, so Franz's watercolor must be on wall 2 or wall 3.\n\nGiven Greene's watercolor is on wall 1 and Isaacs's watercolor must be on either wall 2 or wall 3, wall 2 or wall 3 must have Isaacs's watercolor and either Franz's or Greene's watercolor.

Therefore, wall 4 has Isaacs's oil in the lower position and must have Isaacs's watercolor in the upper position (since wall 1 is taken by Greene's watercolor).\n\nNow, only wall 2 and wall 3 remain for Franz's watercolor.
