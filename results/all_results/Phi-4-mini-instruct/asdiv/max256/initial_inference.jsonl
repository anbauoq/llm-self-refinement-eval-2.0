Each box of bars contains 5 bars, and each box of bottles contains 19 bottles. The total number of bars sold is 5x and the total number of bottles sold is 19y. We are given that these two quantities are equal, so we have the equation 5x = 19y. To find the smallest positive integers x and y that satisfy this equation, we can start with the smallest positive integer for y, which is 1, and find the corresponding x. Substituting y = 1 into the equation, we get 5x = 19 * 1, which simplifies to x = 19/5. Since x must be an integer, we try the next integer value for y, which is 2. Substituting y = 2 into the equation, we get 5x = 19 * 2, which simplifies to x = 38/5. This is still not an integer. We continue this process until we find an integer solution.
