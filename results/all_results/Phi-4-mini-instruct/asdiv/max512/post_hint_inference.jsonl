The problem states that the donation to The Forest Reserve is $140 more than what was given to Animal Preservation Park. It doesn't say that there are two donations of $140.

The total donation to both parks is Y + (Y - $140.00) = $570.00. This simplifies to 2Y - $140.00 = $570.00. Adding $140.00 to both sides gives 2Y = $710.00.
