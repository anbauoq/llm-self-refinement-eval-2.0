You may not use any code to arrive at the answer.\n<cot_start>\nTo solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from 8 people (4 men and 4 women) and then subtract the cases where the group is composed entirely of men or entirely of women.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose 4 presenters from 8 people.\nThis can be done using the combination formula:\n\\[ \\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \\]\nwhere \\( n = 8 \\) and \\( k = 4 \\).\n\n\\[ \\binom{8}{4} = \\frac{8!}{4!4!} = \\frac{8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5}{4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 70 \\]\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose 4 men from 4 men.\n\\[ \\binom{4}{4} = \\frac{4!}{4!0!} = 1 \\]\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of ways to choose 4 women from 4 women.\n\\[ \\binom{4}{4} = \\frac{4!}{4!0!} = 1 \\]\n\nStep 4: Subtract the invalid groups (all men and all women) from the total number of groups.\n\\[ \\text{Valid groups} = 70 - 1 - 1 = 68 \\]\n\nStep 5: Recheck the combinations and the subtraction process.\n\n\\[ 70 - 1 - 1 = 68 \\]\n\nSo, the total number of different groups of presenters that can be chosen, ensuring the group is not composed entirely of men or entirely of women, is 68.\n\nHowever, the answer choices provided do not include 68.
