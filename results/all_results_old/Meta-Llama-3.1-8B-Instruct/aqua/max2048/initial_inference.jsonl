Since the difference between Q and R's age is 0, the difference between R and Q's age is also 0.\nHowever, this is not an option. Therefore, the correct answer is D)Cannot be determined.","full_output":"<cot_start>\nLet's say R's age is R and T's age is T. We know that R + T = 50.\nWe also know that Q is as much younger than R as he is older than T. This means that R - Q = Q - T.\nWe can rewrite this as R - 2Q = -T.\nWe can substitute T = 50 - R into this equation to get R - 2Q = - (50 - R).\nSimplifying this, we get R - 2Q = -50 + R.\nSubtracting R from both sides, we get -2Q = -50.\nDividing both sides by -2, we get Q = 25.\nNow we can find R by substituting Q = 25 into R + T = 50. This gives us R + 25 = 50.\nSubtracting 25 from both sides, we get R = 25.\nNow we can find the difference between R and Q's age by subtracting Q's age from R's age. This gives us 25 - 25 = 0.\nHowever, we are asked for the difference between R and Q's age, not the difference between Q and R's age. Since the difference between Q and R's age is 0, the difference between R and Q's age is also 0.\nHowever, this is not an option.

We know that A + S = 30 grams.\nWe also know that the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver. The volume of a cylinder is πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The radius of the coin is 7.5 mm, and the height is 2 mm. Therefore, the volume of the coin is π(7.5)^2(2) = 176.71 mm^3.\nThe weight of aluminum is A = 176.71 * ρ, where ρ is the density of aluminum.

This is impossible, so the initial assumption that the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver is incorrect.\nLet's assume that the volume of aluminum is V and the volume of silver is V.

Let's try to find the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum using the answer options.\nLet's denote the weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum as W. We know that W = V * ρ, where V is the volume of the new coin and ρ is the density of aluminum. The volume of the new coin is π(15)^2(1) = 707.96 mm^3. The density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3 = 2700 kg/m^3 = 2.7 g/cm^3. Therefore, W = 707.96 * 2.7 = 1915.32 grams.\nThe weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum is W / 2 = 957.66 grams.

However, this is not among the answer options","full_output":"<cot_start>\nLet's denote the weight of aluminum as A and the weight of silver as S. We know that A + S = 30 grams.\nWe also know that the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver. The volume of a cylinder is πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The radius of the coin is 7.5 mm, and the height is 2 mm. Therefore, the volume of the coin is π(7.5)^2(2) = 176.71 mm^3.\nThe weight of aluminum is A = 176.71 * ρ, where ρ is the density of aluminum. The density of aluminum is 2.7 g/cm^3 = 2700 kg/m^3 = 2.7 g/cm^3. Therefore, A = 176.71 * 2.7 = 476.31 grams.\nThe weight of silver is S = 30 - A = 30 - 476.31 = -446.31 grams. This is impossible, so the initial assumption that the volume of aluminum equals the volume of silver is incorrect.\nLet's assume that the volume of aluminum is V and the volume of silver is V. The weight of aluminum is A = V * ρ, where ρ is the density of aluminum. The weight of silver is S = V * ρ, where ρ is the density of silver. The density of silver is 10.5 g/cm^3 = 10500 kg/m^3 = 10.5 g/cm^3. Therefore, S = 10500 * V.\nWe know that A + S = 30 grams. Therefore, V * ρ + V * ρ = 30 grams. Therefore, V * (ρ + ρ) = 30 grams. Therefore, V * (2 * ρ) = 30 grams. Therefore, V = 30 / (2 * ρ).\nThe volume of the new coin is π(15)^2(1) = 707.96 mm^3. The weight of the new coin is A = V * ρ = 707.96 * 2.7 = 1915.32 grams.\nThe weight of the new coin made of pure aluminum is 1915.32 / 2 = 957.66 grams. However, this is not among the answer options.
