{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n# Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","chain_of_thought":"Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nLet the distance from the car to the base of the tower be x. We can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation to the distance:\n\ntan(45°) = (height of tower) / x\n1 = (height of tower) / x\nheight of tower = x\n\ntan(60°) = (height of tower) / (x + d)\n√3 = x / (x + d)\n\nwhere d is the additional distance the car travels after the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°.\n\nWe know that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes, so the car travels a distance d in this time. We can use the formula:\n\nd = speed × time\nd = x / (60 × 10)\n\nWe can now substitute this expression for d into the second equation:\n\n√3 = x / (x + x / (60 × 10))\n√3 = x / (x + x / 600)\n√3 = x / ((600x + x) / 600)\n√3 = 600x / 601x\n√3 = 600 / 601\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\nx = 600 / (√3 × 601)\nx = 600 / (√3 × 601)\nx = 600 / (√3 × 601)\nx = 600 / (√3 × 601)\nx ≈ 0.986\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the time it takes for the car to cover this distance:\n\ntime = distance / speed\ntime = x / speed\ntime = 0.986 / speed\n\nWe don't know the speed of the car, but we can use the fact that it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°.

Then:\n\n10 = x / s\n10 = 0.986 / s\ns = 0.986 / 10\ns = 0.0986\n\nNow that we have the speed, we can find the time it takes for the car to cover the distance x:\n\ntime = distance / speed\ntime = 0.986 / 0.0986\ntime ≈ 10.02 minutes\n\nThe question asks for the additional time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower, so we need to subtract the initial 10 minutes from the total time:\n\nadditional time = time - 10\nadditional time ≈ 10.02 - 10\nadditional time ≈ 0.02 minutes\n\nHowever, this is not among the answer choices, so let's try another approach.\n\nLet's use the fact that the car is traveling at a uniform speed. We can use the concept of similar triangles to relate the distance x to the additional distance d:\n\ntan(45°) / tan(60°) = x / (x + d)\n1 / √3 = x / (x + d)\n\nWe can cross-multiply and simplify:\n\nx + d = x√3\nd = x(√3 - 1)\n\nWe know that d is the additional distance the car travels after the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°, and it takes 10 minutes to cover this distance. We can use the formula:\n\nd = speed × time\nd = s × 10\nd = s × 10\n\nWe can equate this expression for d with the expression we found earlier:\n\ns × 10 = x(√3 - 1)\n\nWe can solve for x:\n\nx = s × 10 / (√3 - 1)\n\nNow that we have the value of x, we can find the time it takes for the car to cover this distance:\n\ntime = distance / speed\ntime = x / s\ntime = (s × 10 / (√3 - 1)) / s\ntime = 10 / (√3 - 1)\n\nTo rationalize the denominator, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by (√3 + 1):\n\ntime = (10(√3 + 1)) / ((√3 - 1)(√3 + 1))\ntime = (10(√3 + 1)) / (√3^2 - 1^2)\ntime = (10(√3 + 1)) / (3 - 1)\ntime = (10(√3 + 1)) / 2\ntime = 5(√3 + 1)\n\nThis matches answer choice A)5(√3 + 1).","full_output":"Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nLet the distance from the car to the base of the tower be x.
