{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n# Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","full_output":"<think> Let H be the height of the tower and D be the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower. For the 45° angle, tan(45°) = H/D, so H = D. For the 60° angle, tan(60°) = H/(D+x), where x is the distance traveled by the car. This gives H/(D+x) = √3. We are given that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes. We know tan(45°) = 1, so the initial rate of change of the angle of elevation is 1/10 radians per minute (1 radian = 45°, so the rate is 1/10 radians per 45°, which is 1/(45/1) × (1/10) radians per degree, and since 1 radian = 1/(45/1) degrees, it is 1/10 radians per minute). The angle changes by 15° in 10 minutes, so the rate of change of the angle is 15°/10 minutes = 1.5°/minute. Let's call the distance traveled by the car during the next time interval x. The angle of elevation will change by 1.5°/minute × time, so we have tan(60°) = H/(D + x), and tan(45°) = H/(D + x + x). We can solve for x in the first equation: H/(D+x) = √3. Rearranging, we have H = √3D + √3x. We know H = D, so D = √3D + √3x, so D(1 - √3) = √3x, so x = D(√3 - 1)/√3. We can now use the fact that the tangent function is defined as the ratio of opposite side to adjacent side to find the relationship between the distance traveled by the car and the time it takes to reach the base of the tower. For the 60° angle, tan(60°) = H/(D+x), and for the 45° angle, tan(45°) = H/(D+x+x). We can solve for x in the first equation: H/(D+x) = √3. Rearranging, we have H = √3D + √3x. We know H = D, so D = √3D + √3x, so D(1 - √3) = √3x, so x = D(√3 - 1)/√3. The time it takes to travel this distance is x/v, where v is the speed of the car. We can now set up a proportion using the tangent values and the given time interval to solve for the distance traveled. The proportion is x/v = 10 minutes, where x = D(√3 - 1)/√3 and v is the speed of the car. We can now solve for the distance traveled. We know that the time it takes to travel this distance is x/v, so we have x/v = (D(√3 - 1)/√3)/v = 10 minutes. Rearranging, we have x = 10v√3/(√3 - 1). We can now use the fact that the distance traveled by the car is equal to the distance from the car to the base of the tower plus the distance traveled by the car: D + x = D + 10v√3/(√3 - 1). We can now solve for the distance traveled by the car: D + 10v√3/(√3 - 1) - D = 10v√3/(√3 - 1). Rearranging, we have 10v√3/(√3 - 1) = 10v(√3 + 1)/(√3 - 1)(√3 + 1), so 10v(√3 + 1)/(√3 - 1) = 10v(√3 + 1)/(3 - 1) = 5v(√3 + 1). We can now solve for the time it takes to travel this distance: 5v(√3 + 1) = 5v(√3 + 1), so 5v(√3 + 1)/v = 5(√3 + 1), so 5(√3 + 1) = 5(√3 + 1). This is the distance traveled by the car, so the time it takes to travel this distance is 5(√3 + 1)/v. We know that the car travels at a uniform speed, so the time it takes to travel a distance is equal to the distance divided by the speed. We can now solve for the time it takes to reach the base of the tower.","chain_of_thought":"<think> Let H be the height of the tower and D be the initial distance from the car to the base of the tower.

We can now use the fact that the distance traveled by the car is equal to the distance from the car to the base of the tower plus the distance traveled by the car: D + x = D + 10v√3/(√3 - 1). We can now solve for the distance traveled by the car: D + 10v√3/(√3 - 1) - D = 10v√3/(√3 - 1). Rearranging, we have 10v√3/(√3 - 1) = 10v(√3 + 1)/(√3 - 1)(√3 + 1), so 10v(√3 + 1)/(√3 - 1) = 10v(√3 + 1)/(3 - 1) = 5v(√3 + 1). We can now solve for the time it takes to travel this distance: 5v(√3 + 1) = 5v(√3 + 1), so 5v(√3 + 1)/v = 5(√3 + 1), so 5(√3 + 1) = 5(√3 + 1). This is the distance traveled by the car, so the time it takes to travel this distance is 5(√3 + 1)/v. We know that the car travels at a uniform speed, so the time it takes to travel a distance is equal to the distance divided by the speed. We can now solve for the time it takes to reach the base of the tower.","predicted_answer":null,"ground_truth":"A","is_correct":null,"from_retry":false}
