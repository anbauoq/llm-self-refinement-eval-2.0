We are told the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so 0.78p - 20 = 0.5p + 1.90. Let's solve for p: 0.78p - 0.5p = 1.90 + 20 = 21.90, so 0.28p = 21.90, and p = 21.90 / 0.28 = 78.20. This matches option E.","full_output":"<think>Let p be the original price of the item.

Prime factorization of 9 is 3^2 and 12 is 2^2 * 3. LCM of two numbers is the product of the highest power of each prime factor. Therefore, the LCM of 9 and 12 is 2^2 * 3^2 = 4 * 9 = 36.
