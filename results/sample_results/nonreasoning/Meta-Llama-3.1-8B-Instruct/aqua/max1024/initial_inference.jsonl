{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n# Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","chain_of_thought":"Let's denote the distance from the car to the base of the tower as d, and the height of the tower as h. Since the car is moving at a uniform speed, we can consider the time it takes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60° as a constant time interval. Let's call this time interval t. We can use the tangent function to relate the angles, the height of the tower, and the distance d. For the 45° angle, we have tan(45°) = h / d, which simplifies to h = d. For the 60° angle, we have tan(60°) = h / (d + vt), where v is the speed of the car. Since h = d, we get tan(60°) = d / (d + vt), which simplifies to √3 = 1 + vt/d. We are given that the time interval t = 10 minutes. We can now use the fact that the distance d remains the same during the time interval t. We can use the equation d = vt to relate the distance d to the speed v. Substituting this into the previous equation, we get √3 = 1 + t/v. We can now solve for t/v: t/v = √3 - 1. Since we know that t = 10 minutes, we can now solve for v: v = t / (√3 - 1). We can now use the fact that the car will take the same amount of time to travel the distance d at a uniform speed v. Therefore, the additional time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower is d/v. We can now substitute the expression for v into this equation: d/v = d / (t / (√3 - 1)) = (√3 - 1)t. Since t = 10 minutes, we get the additional time as (√3 - 1) * 10.

The train covers 1/4 of the distance at 100 miles/hour. This quarter distance is 1000/4 = 250 miles. It takes 250/100 = 2.5 hours to cover this quarter distance. After covering the quarter distance, the train slows down to 75 miles/hour. The remaining distance is 3/4 of the total distance, which is 3/4 * 1000 = 750 miles.

If all 90 students who attended the prom night also attended the debating session, then the minimum number of students who attended at least one event is 70 + 90 = 160.
