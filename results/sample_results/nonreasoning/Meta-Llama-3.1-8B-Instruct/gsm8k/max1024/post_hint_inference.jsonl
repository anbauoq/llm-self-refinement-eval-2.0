{"id":3,"question":"Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?","chain_of_thought":"Josh bought the house for $80,000. He added $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost was 80,000 + 50,000 = $130,000. This increased the value of the house by 150%, so the new value is 1.5 * 80,000 = $120,000. He sold the house for $120,000, so his profit is 120,000 - 130,000 = -$10,000. However, we are looking for his profit, which is the difference between what he sold the house for and what it cost him to buy and repair. The cost was $130,000, and he sold it for $120,000. So, his profit is 130,000 - 120,000 = $10,000. However, he only spent $80,000 to buy the house, and he sold it for $120,000. The profit is therefore 120,000 - 80,000 = $40,000.","full_output":"<think>Josh bought the house for $80,000. He added $50,000 in repairs, so the total cost was 80,000 + 50,000 = $130,000.
