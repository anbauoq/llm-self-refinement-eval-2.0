{"id":8,"question":"Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. How load does it take to download the file?","chain_of_thought":"Carla can normally download 2 GB/minute. First, we need to find out how much of the file is downloaded before the restart. Since 40% of the file is downloaded, 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 × 200 = 80 GB. It takes 80 ÷ 2 = 40 minutes to download 80 GB. After the restart, Carla needs to download the entire remaining 120 GB. It takes 120 ÷ 2 = 60 minutes to download 120 GB. So in total, it takes 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes to download the file.","full_output":"<think> Carla can normally download 2 GB/minute.

{"id":9,"question":"John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?","full_output":"<think> John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he traveled is 60 × 3 = 180 miles. He was driving away from home in the first leg. He then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph. He drives 15 miles towards home, and then 120 miles towards home. The distance he traveled from home in the second leg is 15 + 120 = 135 miles. He was driving towards home in the second leg. The distance he is from home after the second leg is 180 - 135 = 45 miles. However, this is not the correct answer. The distance he was from home after the first 3 hours is 180 miles. He then drives 15 miles towards home, making him 165 miles from home. He then drives 120 miles towards home, making him 45 miles from home. Since John turns around after the initial 3 hours, the distance he travels in the first leg should be subtracted from the distance traveled in the second leg to find the final distance from home.
