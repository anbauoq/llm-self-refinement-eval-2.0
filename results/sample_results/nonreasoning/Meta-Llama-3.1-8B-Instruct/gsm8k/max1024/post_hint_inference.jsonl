{"id":8,"question":"Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. How load does it take to download the file?","chain_of_thought":"Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file. 40% of 200 is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB. So, she downloads 80 GB in some time, but we don't know how long it takes.\n\nThen, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes.\n\nAfter the restart, Carla has to download the entire file from the beginning. The entire file is 200 GB, and she can download 2 GB/minute. So, it will take her 200 / 2 = 100 minutes to download the entire file from the beginning.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the total time it takes to download the file after the restart, and then add the initial time it took to download 40% of the file and the time it took to install the updates. We already know the time it took to install the updates is 20 minutes. The initial time it took to download 40% of the file is not given, but we can find it by dividing the amount downloaded (80 GB) by the download speed (2 GB/minute), which is 80 / 2 = 40 minutes.\n\nSo, the total time it takes to download the file after the restart is the time it takes to download the entire file (100 minutes) plus the initial time it took to download 40% of the file (40 minutes) and the time it took to install the updates (20 minutes). Therefore, the total time is 100 + 40 + 20 = 160 minutes.","full_output":"Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, Carla downloads 40% of the 200 GB file. 40% of 200 is 0.4 x 200 = 80 GB.

{"id":9,"question":"John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?","chain_of_thought":"In the first 3 hours, John drives at a speed of 60 mph. To find the distance he covers in this time, we need to multiply the speed by the time: 60 × 3 = 180 miles. This means he is 180 miles away from home. Now, he spends 2 hours in standstill traffic, which means he doesn't cover any distance. Then, he drives at a speed of 30 mph for half an hour, so the distance covered in this time is 30 × 0.5 = 15 miles. Finally, he drives at a speed of 80 mph for the remaining 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours. The distance covered in this time is 80 × 1.5 = 120 miles. In total, he covers 15 + 120 = 135 miles in the last part of his trip. Since he was 180 miles away from home initially, and he covers 135 miles, he will be 180 - 135 = 45 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.","full_output":"In the first 3 hours, John drives at a speed of 60 mph.
