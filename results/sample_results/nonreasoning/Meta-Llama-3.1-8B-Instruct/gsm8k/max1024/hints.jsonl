{"id":3,"question":"Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?","chain_of_thought":"The house was originally worth $80,000. Josh put in $50,000 in repairs, which increased the house's value by 150%. First, find the increase in value by multiplying $80,000 by 150%, which is 1.5. Then multiply $80,000 by 1.5 to find the increased value: $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. The profit is the final value minus the original cost and the repairs: $120,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $-10,000. However, Josh has $50,000 of his own money back in the repairs, so the real profit is $120,000 - $80,000 = $40,000.","full_output":"<think>The house was originally worth $80,000.
