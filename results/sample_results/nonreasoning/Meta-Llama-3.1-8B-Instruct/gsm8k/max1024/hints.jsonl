{"id":8,"question":"Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. How load does it take to download the file?","chain_of_thought":"To find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and then the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 × 200 = 80 GB. At a rate of 2 GB/minute, it takes 80 ÷ 2 = 40 minutes to download 80 GB. The updates take 20 minutes. The remaining 60% of the file is 0.6 × 200 = 120 GB. It takes 120 ÷ 2 = 60 minutes to download 120 GB. So the total time is 40 + 20 + 60 = 120 minutes.","full_output":"<think>\nTo find the total time it takes to download the file, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the first 40% of the file, the time it takes to install the updates, and then the time it takes to download the remaining 60% of the file. 40% of 200 GB is 0.4 × 200 = 80 GB.

{"id":9,"question":"John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.  How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?","chain_of_thought":"First, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, so the distance covered is 3 × 60 = 180 miles. He then turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours, but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during this time. Then he drives for half an hour at 30 mph, which is 0.5 × 30 = 15 miles. The remaining time is 4 − 2 − 0.5 = 1.5 hours, and he drives at 80 mph, so the distance covered in this time is 1.5 × 80 = 120 miles. The total distance from home at the end of the 4 hours is the distance he covered initially plus the distance he covered in the last part of the trip, which is 180 + 120 = 300 miles.","full_output":"<think>\nFirst, John drives for 3 hours at 60 mph, so the distance covered is 3 × 60 = 180 miles.
