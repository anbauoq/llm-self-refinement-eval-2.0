{"id":8,"question":"Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB/minute, but 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning. How load does it take to download the file?","chain_of_thought":"Carla is downloading a 200 GB file. Normally she can download 2 GB/minute. To find out how long it takes to download the file, we need to divide 200 GB by 2 GB/minute, which is 200 ÷ 2 = 100 minutes. However, Windows forces a restart 40% of the way through the download, so we need to calculate how much of the file Carla has downloaded in 40% of 100 minutes. 40% of 100 minutes is 0.4 × 100 = 40 minutes. In 40 minutes, Carla downloads 40 × 2 = 80 GB. The remaining file is 200 - 80 = 120 GB. After the restart, Carla has to download the file from the beginning, so she has already downloaded 80 GB. To download the remaining 120 GB, it will take 120 ÷ 2 = 60 minutes. In total, it will take Carla 40 minutes to download 80 GB initially, plus 60 minutes to download the remaining 120 GB, which is 40 + 60 = 100 minutes.","full_output":"<think> Carla is downloading a 200 GB file.

{"id":9,"question":"John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home.  He tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.  He spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30mph, before being able to drive the remaining time of the 4 hours going at 80 mph.

Then he turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. In the first 2 hours, he is stuck in traffic, so he doesn't move. He then drives at 30 mph for 0.5 hours, which is 30 × 0.5 = 15 miles. He then drives at 80 mph for the remaining 4 - 2 - 0.5 = 1.5 hours. The distance he covers in the last 1.5 hours is 80 × 1.5 = 120 miles.
