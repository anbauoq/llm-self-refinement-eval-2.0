In soccer, a double stepover is not a standard action used in traditional soccer matches. It is more commonly associated with ice hockey, where players use stepovers to change direction or win a penalty.\n\n2. **Consider the context**: The World Cup is a high-level soccer tournament, and the action of a double stepover is not a typical soccer action. It is more likely to be found in ice hockey or other sports that use similar actions.\n\n3. **Evaluate the probability**: Given that Samir Nasri is a soccer player and the action is not a standard soccer action, it is highly unlikely that Samir nasri would perform a double stepover in a World Cup match.
