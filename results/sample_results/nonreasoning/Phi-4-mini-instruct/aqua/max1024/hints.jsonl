Remember that the distance traveled by the car in the last 10 seconds must be calculated using the difference in angles and the speed of the vehicle, which can be found from the change in the angle over time. This will involve solving a quadratic equation for the car's speed and then calculating the additional time needed to reach the bottom of the hill."}
