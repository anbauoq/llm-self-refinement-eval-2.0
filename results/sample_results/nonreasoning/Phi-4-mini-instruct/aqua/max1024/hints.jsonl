{"id":1,"question":"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?\n# Answer option: ['A)$61', 'B)$65', 'C)$67.40', 'D)$70', 'E)$78.20']","chain_of_thought":"and","full_output":"Let's denote the original price of the item as \\( P \\).\n\n1. The item is discounted by 22%, so the discounted price is \\( 0.78P \\).\n2. The customer uses a $20-off coupon, so the final price paid is \\( 0.78P - 20 \\).\n3. According to the problem, the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, which gives us the equation:\n   \\[\n   0.78P - 20 = 0.5P + 1.90\n   \\]\n\nNow, we solve for \\( P \\):\n\\[\n0.78P - 0.5P = 20 + 1.90\n\\]\n\\[\n0.28P = 21.90\n\\]\n\\[\nP = \\frac{21.90}{0.28}\n\\]\n\\[\nP = 78.21\n\\]\n\nThus, the original price of the item is $78.21.\n\nThe correct answer is:\n<ans>E</ans>This is not the correct answer.

The company produces 420 units per month, so in a year, it produces 420 units/month * 12 months = 5040 units. The production cost per unit is $110, so the total production cost for the year is 5040 units * $110/unit = $554,400.\n\nNext, we need to find the total revenue required to achieve a yearly profit of at least $626,400. The profit is the revenue minus the production cost, so we set up the equation:\n\nRevenue - Production Cost = Profit\nRevenue - $554,400 = $626,400\n\nSolving for Revenue, we get:\nRevenue = $626,400 + $554,400\nRevenue = $1,180,800\n\nNow, we divide the total revenue by the number of units produced in a year to find the minimum selling price per unit:\nMinimum Selling Price = Total Revenue / Number of Units\nMinimum Selling Price = $1,180,800 / 5040 units\nMinimum Selling Price = $234.2857\n\nSince we need to choose an answer from the given options, we round up to the nearest dollar that is available in the options, which is $240.\n\nTherefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit is $240.\n</think>\n\n<ans>C</ans><think>\nFirst, we need to calculate the total production cost for the year.

To solve this question, you need to understand the relationships between the discounted price, the coupon, and half the original price. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Let the original price be \\( P \\).\n2. The discounted price is \\( P - 0.22P = 0.78P \\).\n3. After applying the $20 coupon, the price becomes \\( 0.78P - 20 \\).\n4.
