This is given by the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since we don't know the joint probability P(A and B), we can assume the worst case scenario where P(A and B) = 0 (no overlap). So, P(A or B) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0 = 1.30. However, probabilities cannot exceed 1, so we cap P(A or B) at 1. The probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is then: 1 - P(A or B) = 1 - 1 = 0. In this scenario, we need to consider the maximum value for P(A or B) that fits within probability limits (i.e., it can't exceed 1). Since we assumed no overlap, the worst-case scenario for neither event happening would be when both events are just possible but not guaranteed to occur together, hence we look for the complementary probability within logical bounds. Given the options, we can see the maximum non-overlapping probability that neither event occurs is indeed 0, but as a consideration of practical choices, the smallest provided value within reason is still the highest non-zero possibility.

The sum of the individual probabilities is 0.56 + 0.74 = 1.30. Since probabilities cannot exceed 1, the combined maximum probability for either Stock A or Stock B increasing in value is capped at 1. The probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value is thus 1 - 1 = 0.
