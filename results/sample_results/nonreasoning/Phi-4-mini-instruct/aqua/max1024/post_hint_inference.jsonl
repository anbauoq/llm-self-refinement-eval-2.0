{"id":3,"question":"If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?\n# Answer option: ['A)0.22', 'B)0.26', 'C)0.37', 'D)0.46', 'E)0.63']","chain_of_thought":"<ththink> The probability that Stock A will not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44. The probability that Stock B will not increase in value is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. For the events to occur together (neither Stock A nor Stock B increasing), we can multiply their individual probabilities: 0.44 × 0.26 = 0.1144. The closest answer option that is less than 0.1144 is 0.22. However, since we need the greatest value less than 0.1144, we should check the next smallest option, which is 0.26, and it indeed matches the requirement. So, the correct answer should be 0.26.","full_output":"<ththink> The probability that Stock A will not increase in value is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44.
