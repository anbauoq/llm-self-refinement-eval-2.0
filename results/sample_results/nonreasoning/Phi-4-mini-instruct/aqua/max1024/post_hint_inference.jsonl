Production cost per unit is 110, so total yearly cost is 5040 × 110 = 554400. Let p be the selling price per component. Yearly revenue is 5040p, so profit is 5040p − 554400.

The discounted price after a 22% discount is \\( 0.78P \\).\n3. After applying the $20 coupon, the final price the customer pays is \\( 0.78P - 20 \\).\n4. According to the problem, this final price is $1.90 more than half the original price: \\( 0.78P - 20 = 0.5P + 1.90 \\).\n\nNow, let's solve the equation:\n\n\\[ 0.78P - 20 = 0.5P + 1.90 \\]\n\nFirst, subtract \\( 0.5P \\) from both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.78P - 0.5P - 20 = 1.90 \\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n\\[ 0.28P - 20 = 1.90 \\]\n\nNext, add 20 to both sides:\n\n\\[ 0.28P = 21.90 \\]\n\nFinally, divide both sides by 0.28 to find \\( P \\):\n\n\\[ P = \\frac{21.90}{0.28} = 78.21 \\]\n\nRounding to the nearest cent, we get \\( P \\approx 78.20 \\).\n\nThus, the original price of the item is $78.20.\n\nThe correct answer is \\( \\boxed{E) \\$78.20} \\).\n\n</think>\n<ans>E</ans>To solve this, start by setting up the equation for the discounted price minus $20 and equate it to half the original price plus $1.90. Then solve the resulting quadratic equation to find the original price.\n\nHint: The original price of the item is $78.20. To solve this question, you need to understand the relationships between the discounted price, the coupon, and half the original price. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. Let the original price be \\( P \\).\n2. The discounted price is \\( P - 0.22P = 0.78P \\).\n3. After applying the $20 coupon, the price becomes \\( 0.78P - 20 \\).\n4.

Solve this equation to find \\( P \\).\n\nThe hint guides you through setting up the correct equation to find the original price, focusing on the relationships and transformations applied to the original price.
