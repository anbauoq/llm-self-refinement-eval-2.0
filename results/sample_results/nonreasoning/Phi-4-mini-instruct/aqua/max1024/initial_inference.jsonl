The minimum number who could attend both events is the smaller of the two percentages, which in this case is 35%. So, at most 35 students attended both the prom and the debating.\n\nThe total number who did at least one of the events is 45 (prom) + 35 (debating) - 35 = 45 students.\n\nSo, the maximum who did neither is 200 - 45 = 155 students.\n\nHowever, this number is not in the options, so we need a different approach.\n\nIf 35 is the number attending both, then the number only attending the prom is 40 (45% of 200) -35 =5, and only attending debating is 70 (35% of200) – 35= 35. So, the total attending at least an event is 5+35+35=75. So the maximum not attending either is 125.\n\nAgain, this is not an option, so let's try another approach.\n\nThe maximum number who didn't attend either is when the minimum number attended both. So we take the smaller percentage, which means 35%, and subtract it from the total. So 200 * 35/100 =70 students attended at least the debating. The maximum number not attending is  200-70 = 130. This is still not an answer option, but we can see that the answer must be less than 130.\n\nThe next smallest percentage is 27 (45-18), so we take 200*27/100= 54 students attended the Prom. The number who only attended the debating is then 70-54= 16. So total attending is now 54+16+35 =105. The remaining number not attended either is then, 200 – 105 = 95. This number is still too high, so let’s try the next smallest, which would be 15 (45 - 30). So 15% of the students attended only the prom, which gives us 200 x 15/100  = 30 students. The total attending now is 30 + 16 + 30 = 76. The students not attending are then 200–76 = 124, which still too large. The next smallest is 12 (45 – 33), so 12% of students attended just the prom. This gives us another 24 students. So now the total is 24 + 12 + 36 = 72.

The non-attendees are then, (200 –48) =152, which too large, so finally we try 6 (45 − 39), which gives 12 students. Now the total becomes 12+6+21=39. The final number of non-attendee is 161, which also too large.\nSo, we have to try the smallest percentage, 0 (45−45), which means no students attended prom.
