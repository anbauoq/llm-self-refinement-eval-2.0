Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n\nIf Helen, Kyle, and Lenore, not necessarily in that order, give the three morning reports, which one of the following must be true?\nA) Helen gives a report on Monday.\nB) Irving gives a report on Monday.\nC) Irving gives a report on Wednesday.\nD) Kyle gives a report on Tuesday.\nE) Kyle gives a report on Wednesday.","chain_of_thought":"We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday and that Nina's report causes Helen and Irving to report the next day. Since Helen, Kyle, and Lenore are in the morning reports, and George is in the afternoon report on Tuesday, Nina must be in the morning report on Monday. This is the only way that Nina's report can cause Helen and Irving to report the next day, which is Tuesday. Therefore, Nina must give her report on Monday.","full_output":"First, we know Helen, Kyle, and Lenore give the three morning reports. Since exactly two reports are given each day, the afternoon reports must be given by George, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. Given that George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot be in the morning reports. Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must be in the morning reports. This leaves Nina and one more person for the morning reports (Helen, Kyle, or Lenore), and George, Olivia, and Robert for the afternoon reports.\n\nSince Helen, Kyle, and Lenore are in the morning reports, we need to assign them to the three days. Given that George can only give a report on Tuesday, he must be in the afternoon report on Tuesday. This leaves Monday and Wednesday for Helen, Kyle, and Lenore. Since Nina's report causes Helen and Irving to report the next day, Nina must give her report on Monday (if she reports at all), causing Helen and Irving to report on Tuesday.\n\nThis means the morning reports on Monday are Helen and Nina, and on Tuesday, Helen, Irving, and Lenore give the morning reports. On Wednesday, Kyle and Lenore must give the morning reports. George gives the afternoon report on Tuesday. Olivia and Robert are left for the afternoon reports, and since Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, they must be in the morning reports on Monday and Wednesday respectively.\n\nTherefore, the assignments are:\n- Monday: Helen, Nina, Olivia\n- Tuesday: Helen, Irving, Lenore, George\n- Wednesday: Kyle, Lenore, Robert\n\nFrom these assignments, we can see that Helen gives a report on Monday.\n\nAnswer:\nA) Helen gives a report on Monday.<ans>A</ans>Correct, the reasoning provided is accurate, and the final answer is indeed A) Helen gives a report on Monday.If George can only give a report on Tuesday, what day must Nina give her report?\nA) Monday\nB) Tuesday\nC) Wednesday\nD) Cannot be determined from the given information\n\n<think>\nWe know that George can only give a report on Tuesday and that Nina's report causes Helen and Irving to report the next day.

This is the only way that Nina's report can cause Helen and Irving to report the next day, which is Tuesday.
