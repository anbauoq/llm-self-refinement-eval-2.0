She has twice as many chocolate candies as strawberry candies and three times as many mint candies as chocolate candies. If she has 6 strawberry candies, how much more money would she need to buy 10 more chocolate candies at $2 each and 5 more mint candies at 50 cents each?\n\nYour reasoning:\n- I calculated that Lisa has twice the number as strawberry, so 6 x 2 = 12 chocolate candies.\n- I then calculated that she has three times the number chocolate candies, so she has (12 x 3) = 36 mint candies.\nNow, I need to find out how much she would spend on the additional candies.\nFor chocolate candies: 10 x $2 = $20.\nFor mint candies: (5 x 50) cents = $2.50.\nSo, Lisa would need $20 + $2 + $0.50 = $22.50 more.\nMy answer: $22\nCorrect Answer: $23.50\n<hHint>Remember to account for the additional cost of each type of candy separately and then sum these amounts to find how much additional money Lisa needs. Also, ensure to convert the mint candies' cost to dollars before adding.</hint>"}
