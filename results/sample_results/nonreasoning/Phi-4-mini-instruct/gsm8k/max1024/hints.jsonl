{"id":5,"question":"Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","chain_of_thought":"Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per meal, and there are 20 chickens, so each meal requires 3 × 20 = 60 cups of feed. Wendi gives 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. The total feed given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups. The total amount of feed needed for the day is 60 × 3 = 180 cups. Therefore, the amount needed for the final meal is 180 - 40 = 140 cups.","full_output":"Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per meal, and there are 20 chickens, so each meal requires 3 × 20 = 60 cups of feed.

Then, subtract the feed already given in the morning and afternoon from this total to find the amount needed for the final meal.</hint> The hint provides guidance on how to correctly calculate the total daily feed requirement and how to find the remaining amount needed for the final meal without directly stating the final result."}
