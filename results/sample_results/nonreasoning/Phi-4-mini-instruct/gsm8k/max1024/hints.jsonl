{"id":5,"question":"Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","chain_of_thought":"First, we need to determine the total amount of feed Wendi gives to her chickens in the morning and afternoon:\nMorning feed: 15 cups\nAfternoon feed: 25 cups\n\nTotal feed given in the morning and afternoon:\n15 + 25 = 40 cups\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total amount of feed each chicken receives in a day. Since each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per meal and there are 3 meals in a day:\n3 cups/meal * 3 meals/day = 9 cups/day per chicken\n\nNow, we multiply the daily feed per chicken by the number of chickens (20):\n9 cups/day * 20 chickens = 180 cups/day for all chickens\n\nFinally, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total daily feed needed:\n180 cups/day - 40 cups = 140 cups\n\nSo, Wendi needs to give her chickens 140 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.","full_output":"<cot_start>\nFirst, we need to determine the total amount of feed Wendi gives to her chickens in the morning and afternoon:\nMorning feed: 15 cups\nAfternoon feed: 25 cups\n\nTotal feed given in the morning and afternoon:\n15 + 25 = 40 cups\n\nNext, we need to calculate the total amount of feed each chicken receives in a day.

{"id":8,"question":"Carla is downloading a 200 GB file.
