{"id":5,"question":"Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","chain_of_thought":"Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per meal. Wendi feeds the chickens in three meals a day. In the morning, she feeds them 15 cups, and in the afternoon, she feeds them 25 cups. Since the chickens get 3 cups per meal, she must have 15 / 3 = 5 chickens in the morning and 25 / 3 = 8.33, which rounds to 9 chickens in the afternoon. Adding these gives 5 + 9 = 14 chickens fed. Wendi has 20 chickens in total, so 20 - 14 = 6 chickens need to be fed in the final meal. Each of these 6 chickens will get 3 cups of feed. Therefore, she needs 6 * 3 = 18 cups of feed for the final meal.","full_output":"<think>Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per meal. Wendi feeds the chickens in three meals a day.
