{"id":5,"question":"Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed, containing seeds, mealworms and vegetables to help keep them healthy.  She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed.  In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed.  How many cups of feed does she need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day if the size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens?","chain_of_thought":"Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per meal. Wendi has 20 chickens, so each meal, each chicken gets 3 cups. Total feed per meal for 20 chickens = 20 * 3 = 60 cups. In the morning, Wendi gives 15 cups. In the afternoon, she gives 25 cups. Total feed given in the morning and afternoon = 15 + 25 = 40 cups. Total feed required for all meals (3 meals per day) = 60 * 3 = 180 cups. Feed needed for the final meal = Total feed required - Total feed already given = 180 - 40 = 140 cups.","full_output":"<think>Each chicken gets 3 cups of feed per meal.
