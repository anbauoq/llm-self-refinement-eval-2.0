{"id":3,"question":"Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?","chain_of_thought":"Josh's initial purchase price is $80,000. The increase in value is 150% of $80,000, which is 1.5 × 80,000 = $120,000. The new value of the house is the original price plus the increase, so $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000. Josh's total investment is the purchase price plus the repairs, which is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. The profit is the new value minus the total investment, so $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.","full_output":"<think> Josh's initial purchase price is $80,000.
