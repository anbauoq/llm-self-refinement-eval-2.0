Let's consider each case for the \"H, K\" block and see where G can be placed.\n\n#### Case 1: \"H, K\" block is in positions (1, 2)\n- G must be in position 3.\n- The remaining positions are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n\n#### Case 2: \"H, K\" block is in positions (2, 3)\n- G must be in position 4.\n- The remaining positions are 1, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n\n#### Case 3: \"H, K\" block is in positions (3, 4)\n- G must be in position 5.\n- The remaining positions are 1, 2, 6, 7, 8.\n\n### Step 4: Place the remaining books\nWe need to place the remaining books (L, M, N, O) in the remaining positions. We also need to ensure that the conditions are met:\n- H is to the left of J.\n- K is immediately to the right of H.\n- G is not at either end.\n\n### Step 5: Test each case\nLet's test each case to see if we can satisfy all the conditions.\n\n#### Case 1: \"H, K\" block in positions (1, 2)\n- G in position 3.\n- Remaining positions: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n- We need to place L, M, N, O in these positions.\n\n#### Case 2: \"H, K\" block in positions (2, 3)\n- G in position 4.\n- Remaining positions: 1, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n- We need to place L, M, N, O in these positions.\n\n#### Case 3: \"H, K\" block in positions (3, 4)\n- G in position 5.\n- Remaining positions: 1, 2, 6, 7, 8.\n- We need to place L, M, N, O in these positions.\n\n### Step 6: Check each case for consistency\nWe need to ensure that the conditions are met in each case. Let's start with Case 1 and see if we can find a valid arrangement.\n\n#### Case 1: \"H, K\" block in positions (1, 2)\n- G in position 3.\n- Remaining positions: 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n- We need to place L, M, N, O in these positions.\n\nLet's try placing the books in a valid order:\n- H in position 1.\n- K in position 2.\n- G in position 3.\n\nNow, we need to place L, M, N, O in positions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n\n#### Step 7: Verify the solution\nWe need to ensure that the conditions are met:\n- H is to the left of J.\n- K is immediately to the right of H.\n- G is not at either end.\n\nLet's try placing the books in a valid order:\n- H in position 1.\n- K in position 2.\n- G in position 3.\n\nNow, we need to place L, M, N, O in positions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.\n\nLet's try placing the books in a valid order:\n- H in position 1.\n- K in position 2.\n- G in position 3.\n- J in position 4.\n- L in position 5.\n- M in position 6.\n- N in position 7.\n- O in position 8.\n\nThis arrangement satisfies all the conditions.\n\n### Step 8: Determine the correct answer\nThe correct answer is:\n\\boxed{B}","full_output":"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and determine the correct order of the books on the shelf. Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the conditions\n1. **H is somewhere to the left of J.**\n2. **K is immediately to the right of H.**\n3. **G is not at either end of the row.**\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible positions for H, K, and J\nSince K is immediately to the right of H, we can think of them as a block \"H, K\".
