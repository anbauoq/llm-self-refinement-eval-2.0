Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the constraints:**\n   - Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.\n   - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.\n   - If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and�ie must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n\n2. **Determine the reports for Tuesday:**\n   - Since Tuesday is the only day George can give a report, and we need two reports per day, George must give the morning report on Tuesday.\n   - Therefore, the afternoon report on Tuesday must be given by one of the other students, but not by Olivia or Robert.\n\n3. **Determine the reports for Wednesday:**\n   - If Nina gives a report, then Helen and�ie must both give reports on Wednesday, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n   - Since we need to determine the reports for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and we already know the Tuesday reports, we need to consider the implications of Nina's report.\n\n4. **Analyze the given conditions:**\n   - If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and�ie must both give reports on Wednesday, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n   - Since we need to determine the reports for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and we already know the Tuesday reports, we need to consider the implications of Nina's report.\n\n5. **Determine the reports for Monday:**\n   - Since we need to determine the reports for Monday, we need to consider the implications of the conditions for Monday.\n   - If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and�ie must both give reports on Wednesday, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n   - Since we need to determine the reports for Monday, we need to consider the implications of the conditions for Monday.\n\n6. **Determine the correct sequence:**\n   - From the conditions, we can determine that the correct sequence of reports is:\n     - Monday: Robert, Andy, and Lenore\n     - Tuesday: George, Nina, and Angela\n     - Wednesday: Helen, Andy, and�ie\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{C}.","full_output":"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and determine the correct sequence of morning and afternoon reports for the students.
