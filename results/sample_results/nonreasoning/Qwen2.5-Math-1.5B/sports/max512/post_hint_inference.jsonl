Stockmeyer is to analyze the computational complexity of the set covering problem. The set covering problem is a fundamental problem in combinatorial optimization, where the goal is to select a minimum number of sets from a given collection of sets such that their union covers all the elements in a given universal set. The authors investigate the problem's complexity, showing that it is NP-complete. This means that the problem is as hard as the hardest problems in the class NP, and there is no known polynomial-time algorithm to solve it unless P = NP. The paper also discusses the implications of this result for the design of algorithms and the understanding of the limits of efficient computation.\n\nWhat is the main focus of the research paper \"On the Complexity of the Set Covering Problem\" by M.

Each house has a unique number of pets, ranging from 0 to 100. The total number of pets in the town is 5050. If the number of pets in each house is a perfect square, how many houses have exactly 1 pet?\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine how many houses have exactly 1 pet, given that the total number of pets in the town is 5050 and each house has a unique number of pets that is a perfect square.\n\nFirst, let's identify the perfect squares between 0 and 100. The perfect squares in this range are: 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100. There are 11 perfect squares in this range.\n\nSince each house has a unique number of pets, and there are 100 houses, we need to use each of these perfect squares exactly once.
