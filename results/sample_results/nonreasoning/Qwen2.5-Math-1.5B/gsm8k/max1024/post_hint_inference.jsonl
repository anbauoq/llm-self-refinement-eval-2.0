{"id":3,"question":"Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?","chain_of_thought":"<ans>110,000</ans> To calculate the profit, first, find the increased value of the house. The house was originally worth $80,000, and the repairs added $50,000 to its value, making the total value before the increase $130,000. The increased value is 150% of $130,000, which is 1.5 × $130,000 = $195,000. The profit is the increased value minus the original value, so the profit is $195,000 - $130,000 = $65,000. However, since the question asks for the profit from the repairs alone, we subtract the original value of the house from the increased value, which is $195,000 - $80,000 = $115,000. The correct profit is $115,000, not $110,000 as stated in the question.
