To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given conditions and constraints to determine which pair of students must give reports on Wednesday.\n\nLet's break down the conditions:\n\n1. **Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.**\n2. **Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.**\n3. **If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.**\n\nWe need to determine which pair of students must give reports on Wednesday. Let's analyze the conditions step-by-step:\n\n1. **George can only give a report on Tuesday.**\n2. **Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so they must give a morning report.**\n3. **If Nina gives a report, Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.**\n\nLet's consider the possible scenarios:\n\n- If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, but George can only give a report on Tuesday, so this scenario is not possible.\n- If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday, but George can only give a report on Tuesday, so this scenario is not possible.\n- If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give reports on Wednesday, but George can only give a report on Tuesday, so this scenario is not possible.\n\nThe only possible scenario is if Nina gives a report on Monday, and Helen and Irving give reports on Tuesday. This leaves us with the following assignments:\n- Monday: Nina\n- Tuesday: George\n- Wednesday: Helen, Irving, or Kyle, Lenore, Olivia, or Robert\n\nSince George is fixed on Tuesday, and Nina is fixed on Monday, we need to determine which pair of students must give reports on Wednesday. The only pair that fits the remaining students is Helen and Irving, because they are the only ones left who can give reports on Wednesday.\n\nTherefore, the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday is Helen and Irving.
