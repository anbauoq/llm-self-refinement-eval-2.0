{"id":2,"question":"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\n# Answer option: ['A)36', 'B)15', 'C)17', 'D)5', 'E)7']","chain_of_thought":"- No extra text.\n        - For example:\n        <ans>17</ans>\n        ----\n        <ans>17</ans>\n        <end>\n</body>\n</html> Let's solve the problem step-by-step using Python and SymPy.\n\n### Problem Breakdown\n1. **Question 1:**\n   - **Answer option:** ['A)226', 'B)230', 'C)240', 'D)260', 'E)280']\n   - **Reasoning:** The company produces 420 units per month, and the production cost per unit is $110. The yearly production cost is \\(5040 \\times 110 = 554400\\). Let \\(p\\) be the selling price per component. The yearly revenue is \\(5040p\\), and the profit is \\(5040p - 554400\\). We need \\(5040p - 554400 \\geq 626400\\), so \\(5040p \\geq 1180800\\) and \\(p \\geq 234.3\\). The smallest answer choice at least this large is 240, which is option C.\n   \n2. **Question 2:**\n   - **Answer option:** ['A)7!', 'B)7!/2!', 'C)6!', 'D)5!', 'E)8!']\n   - **Reasoning:** The word \"BEATLES\" has 7 distinct letters. The number of distinct arrangements of these 7 letters is \\(7!\\). Since one letter (E) appears twice, the number of distinct arrangements is \\(7!/2!\\), which is option B.\n   \n3. **Question 3:**\n   - **Answer option:** ['A)(zy – 2x)/z', 'B)(zy – 2)/z', 'C)(zx – y)/(z – 2)', 'D)(zy – 2x)/(z -2)', 'E)(zy – x)/(z + 2)']\n   - **Reasoning:** Let the highest score be \\(H\\) and the lowest be \\(L\\). We are given \\((H + L)/2 = x\\), so \\(H + L = 2x\\). The total sum of all \\(z\\) scores is \\(zy\\), so the sum of the remaining \\(z-2\\) scores is \\(zy - (H + L) = zy - 2x\\). The average score excluding the highest and lowest is \\((zy - 2x)/(z - 2)\\), which matches option D.\n   \n4. **Question 4:**\n   - **Answer option:** ['A)65000', 'B)64543', 'C)74325', 'D)74453', 'E)97656']\n   - **Reasoning:** We want a pattern: Letter, Letter, Digit, Digit. Assume the two letters must be different from each other, and the digits can repeat. For the first letter, there are 26 choices. For the second letter, there are 25 choices, because it must be different from the first letter. For each digit position, there are 10 choices (0 to 9). Total number of plates: \\(26 \\times 25 \\times 10 \\times 10 = 26 \\times 25 \\times 100 = 65000\\). So the correct answer is 65000, which is option A.\n   \n5. **Question 5:**\n   - **Answer option:** ['A)9', 'B)11', 'C)31', 'D)25', 'E)22']\n   - **Reasoning:** First find the perimeter of the rectangle: \\(2 \\times (27 + 17) = 2 \\times 44 = 88\\) cm. When the wire is bent into a square, the perimeter stays 88 cm, so each side of the square is \\(88 \\div 4 = 22\\) cm, which is option E.\n   \n6. **Question 6:**\n   - **Answer option:** ['A)180', 'B)185', 'C)189', 'D)190', 'E)195']\n   - **Reasoning:** The marked price of the phone is $200. It is sold with a 10% discount on the marked price, so the discounted price is \\(200 - 10\\% \\text{ of","full_output":"- No extra text.\n        - For example:\n        <ans>17</ans>\n        ----\n        <ans>17</ans>\n        <end>\n</body>\n</html> Let's solve the problem step-by-step using Python and SymPy.\n\n### Problem Breakdown\n1. **Question 1:**\n   - **Answer option:** ['A)226', 'B)230', 'C)240', 'D)260', 'E)280']\n   - **Reasoning:** The company produces 420 units per month, and the production cost per unit is $110.
