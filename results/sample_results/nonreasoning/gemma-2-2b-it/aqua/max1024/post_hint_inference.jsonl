{"id":1,"question":"The original price of an item is discounted 22%. A customer buys the item at this discounted price using a $20-off coupon. There is no tax on the item, and this was the only item the customer bought. If the customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price of the item, what was the original price of the item?\n# Answer option: ['A)$61', 'B)$65', 'C)$67.40', 'D)$70', 'E)$78.20']","chain_of_thought":"<cot_answer>\nTo solve for the original cost, we can represent the original and discounted price as x and 0,78x. \nThe customer paid 1.80 more then half of the original.
