{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n# Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","chain_of_thought":"Let the distance from the car to the base of the tower be x. We know the car travels at a uniform speed, and we can relate the angle of elevation to the distance using the tangent function. \n\nLet the angle of elevation be θ, and the distance from the car to the base of the tower be x. Then, tan(θ) = x/h, where h is the height of the tower.  \n\nThe angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° as the car moves closer to the tower.\n\nWe can use the following equation to find the time taken:\nt = (θ_final - θ_initial) / (dθ/dt)\n\nSolving for t, we get:\nt = (60° - 45°) / (dθ/dt)\n\nNow, we need to find dθ/dt.  \ndθ/dt = d(60°)/dt - d(45°)/dt. \n\nWe can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation to the distance. \ntan(θ) = x/h. \n\nWe know that the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° as the car moves closer to the tower. \n\nTo find the time it takes for the car to reach the base, we can solve the equation for t.\nt = (60° - 45°) / (dθ/dt).","full_output":"<think>\nLet the distance from the car to the base of the tower be x.
