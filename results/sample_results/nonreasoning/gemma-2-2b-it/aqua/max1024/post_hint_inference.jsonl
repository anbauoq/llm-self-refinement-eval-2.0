The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n\nOptions:\nA)5(√3 + 1)\nB)6(√3 + √2)\nC)7(√3 – 1)\nD)8(√3 – 2)\nE)None of these","chain_of_thought":"The angle of elevation is changing from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes. The angle of elevation is changing from 60° to 90° in 10 minutes. The angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes, and the angle of elevation changes from 60° to 90° in 10 minutes. The time it takes for the angle of elevation to change is directly proportional to the change in the angle, and we need to find the time for the angle to change from 60° to 90°.","full_output":"<think>The angle of elevation is changing from 45° to 60° in 10 minutes.

The profit is 0.20x. The selling price is 1.20x (100% + 20%). The selling price is Rs. 360. So, 1.20x = 360. Solving for x, we get x = 360/1.20 = 300.
