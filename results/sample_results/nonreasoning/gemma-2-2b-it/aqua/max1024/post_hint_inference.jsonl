{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n# Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","chain_of_thought":"Let the distance the car travels be x. The time it takes the car to travel this distance is given by the distance divided by the speed. We know that the car travels at a uniform speed, so the time taken to travel the distance x is x/v, where v is the speed of the car. The angle of elevation is related to the distance traveled and the speed of the car, so we can use the trigonometric function tangent to solve for the distance traveled. The tangent of the angle of elevation is the opposite side divided by the adjacent side. The opposite side is the distance the car travels, and the adjacent side is the height of the tower. The time it takes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60° is related to the distance traveled and the speed of the car. The time it takes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60° is given by the difference in the angles divided by the rate of change of the angle.  The rate of change of the angle is the difference in the angle divided by the time.  So, the time it takes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60° is given by (60° - 45°) / (time taken to change the angle).  The time it takes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60° is the same as the time it takes for the car to travel the distance x.  We can solve for the distance traveled, x, using the relationship between the time, speed, and distance. We can then solve for the time it takes for the car to reach the base of the tower.","full_output":"<think> Let the distance the car travels be x.
