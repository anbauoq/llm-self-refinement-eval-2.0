{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n\nOptions:\nA)5(√3 + 1)\nB)6(√3 + √2)\nC)7(√3 – 1)\nD)8(√3 – 2)\nE)None of these","chain_of_thought":"The time taken to change the angle of elevation is related to the rate of change of the angle. The angle changes by 15° in 10 minutes. The rate of change of the angle is 15/10 = 1.5°. We need to find the time it takes to change the angle to 60° from 45°. The angle changes at a rate of 1.5° per minute.  The time to reach 60° from 45° is (60° - 45°) / 1.5° = 15 minutes. The car needs to travel 15 minutes to reach the base of the tower.","full_output":"<think>The time taken to change the angle of elevation is related to the rate of change of the angle.
