{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n# Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","full_output":"<cot_answer>\nA car is driving towards the tower and it takes time for the car to reach the tower.  We need to calculate the time it takes for the top of a tower to be at a 6o angle to the car.\nThe car is moving towards the ground, so we can use the tangent function. The tangent function is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.  The angle of the car is 49° and the angle is 90° so we have tan(49°) = opposite/adjacent.\nWe can set up the equation tan(60°) = (opposite/adjacent).  The opposite side is the tower's height and the adjacent is the distance the car has traveled.  \nWe know that tan(30°) is the opposite/ adjacent, and we can find the distance traveled by the car using the equation for the tangent.\n<tan(6o) = (tower height)/ (distance travelled)\n<cos(6°) = 0,16 \n<distance traveled = tower height / 016\n<calculate the tower height using the ratio tan(90°) and tan(80°). \n</cot_finish>\n\n<ans><ans>None of the above</ans></ans>","chain_of_thought":"<cot_answer>\nA car is driving towards the tower and it takes time for the car to reach the tower.
