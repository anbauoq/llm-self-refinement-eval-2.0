{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n\nOptions:\nA)5(√3 + 1)\nB)6(√3 + √2)\nC)7(√3 – 1)\nD)8(√3 – 2)\nE)None of these","chain_of_thought":"<ans>C</ans>. \n. \n. \n.","full_output":"<think>The angle of elevation is changing, so we can use trigonometry.  Let the height of the tower be h. The car is moving towards the base of the tower. The angle of elevation is changing from 45° to 60°. The tangent of the angle of elevation is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side. The ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side is tan(45°)=1. The ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side is tan(60°)=√3. The change in the angle of elevation is 15°. The car travels at a constant speed. So, the time taken to reach the base of the tower is 10 minutes. We can use the formula for time to find the time taken. The formula is t = d/v. The distance is h and the speed is v. The time taken is 10 minutes. We can use the formula for the angle of elevation to find the time taken. The formula is tan(θ) = h/d. The angle of elevation is changing from 45° to 60°.
