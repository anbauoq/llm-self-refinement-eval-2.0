This is a trigonometric problem. \n3. **Using Trigonometry:** We can use the tangent function to relate the angle of elevation to the distance of the car from the base of the tower.\n4. **Trigonometric Ratios:**\n   *  The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side.\n   *  When the angle of elevation is 45° the tangent is 1.\n   *  When the angle of elevation is 60°, the tangent is √3.\n5. **Solving for Distance:**  Let the distance of the car from the base of the tower be 'x'.\n   *  We can set up the following equations: \n      *  tan(45°) = x/h  (where 'h' is the height of the tower)\n      *  tan(60°) = x/h \n6. **Solving for Time:** We can use the fact that the car takes 10 minutes to change the angle of elevation from 45° to 60°.
