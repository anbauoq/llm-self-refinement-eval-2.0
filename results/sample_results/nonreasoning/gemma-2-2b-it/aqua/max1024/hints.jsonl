The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n\nOptions:\nA)5(√3 + 1)\nB)6(√3 + √2)\nC)7(√3 – 1)\nD)8(√3 – 2)\nE)None of these","chain_of_thought":"The angle of elevation is the angle formed by the line of sight to the top of the tower and the horizontal line. The angle of elevation changes as the car approaches the base of the tower. We know the car is moving towards the tower, and the angle of elevation changes from 45° to 60°. We can use trigonometry to find the distance the car travels in 10 minutes. The tangent of the angle of elevation is the opposite side divided by the adjacent side. We can use this information to find the distance traveled by the car.","full_output":"<think>The angle of elevation is the angle formed by the line of sight to the top of the tower and the horizontal line.
