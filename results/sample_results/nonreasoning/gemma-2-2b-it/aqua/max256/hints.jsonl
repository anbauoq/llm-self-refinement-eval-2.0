{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n# Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","chain_of_thought":"Let's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry:** The car is moving towards the base of the tower, and the angle of elevation is changing. This means the car is moving closer to the tower.\n\n2. **Trigonometry:** We can use trigonometry to relate the angle of elevation to the distance from the car to the tower.\n\n3. **Time and Distance:** The time it takes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60° is related to the distance traveled by the car.\n\n4. **Solving the Problem:** We can use the given information to find the distance traveled by the car.","full_output":"<cot_start>\nLet's break down the problem:\n\n1. **Understanding the Geometry:** The car is moving towards the base of the tower, and the angle of elevation is changing.
