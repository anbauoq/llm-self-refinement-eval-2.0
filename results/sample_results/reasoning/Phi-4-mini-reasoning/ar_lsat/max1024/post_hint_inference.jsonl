So we have eight students, but only six will present reports over three days—each day has two reports (morning and afternoon). The conditions are a bit complex, so I better take them one by one.\n\nFirst condition: Tuesday can only have George's report. So George must present on Tuesday. Since each day has one morning and afternoon report, George's session is either morning or afternoon on Tuesday.\n\nSecond condition: Neither Olivia Nor Robert can have an afternoon session. So wherever Olivia or Robert are scheduled, their report must be in the AM.\n\nThird condition: If Nina presents, then either Helen and/or Irving must present the next days. Specifically, if Nina is on a day, the next day's reports must include both Helen and Irvine. Unless Nina's day is Wednesday. Wait, the wording says: \"unless Nina's presentation is on Wed.\" So if Nina presents on Monday or Tuesday, the following day (Tuesday or Wednesday) must have both Helen & Irving. If she presents on Wednesday? Then the next \"day\" doesn't exist, so maybe the condition doesn't apply. So Nina on Wednesday doesn't require Helen and Iris on Thursday (but Thursday doesn't exist here). So if she is on any day except Wednesday, the day after must have Helen and Irwin.\n\nFourth condition: Kyle and Linda (wait, 2)) is something.
