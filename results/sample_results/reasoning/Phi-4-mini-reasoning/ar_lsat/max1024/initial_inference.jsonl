Not necessarily Wednesday.\n- **B) Helen and Nina**: If Nina is on Monday/Tuesday, Helen can be on another day. If Nina is on Tuesday, Helen must be on Wednesday.

So, we have eight students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. Six of them will give reports over three days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each day has two slots: morning and afternoon. The conditions are a bit complex, so I need to break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, let's list all the conditions again to make sure I don't miss anything:\n\n1. **George can only report on Tuesday.** So Tuesday is George's day. That means Tuesday will have George in either morning or afternoon. Since each day has two slots, George must be one of those two on Tuesday.\n\n2. **Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.** So wherever Olivia and Robert are scheduled, their time slots must be in the morning. That affects their possible days. Since there are two slots per day, if Olivia or Robert are on a day, they have to be in the morning. If they are scheduled on a day, they can't be in the afternoon. So Olivia and Robert must be on days where there's a morning slot available, but they can't be in the afternoon. \n\n3. **If Nina gives a report, then the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.** So if Nina is on Monday, then Tuesday must have both Helen and Irving. If Nina is on Tuesday, then Wednesday must have both Helen and Irving. But if Nina is on Wednesday, this condition doesn't apply. \n\nThe question asks: Which pair of students, if they report on the same day, must necessarily be on Wednesday?\n\nLet's look at the options:\n\nA) George and Lenore  \nB) Helen and Nina  \nC) Irving and Robert  \nD) Kyle and Nina  \nE) Olivia and Kyle  \n\nWe need to check each pair to see if their co-reporting day must be Wednesday.\n\nStarting with **A) George and Lenore**: George is only on Tuesday. Lenore isn't mentioned in any constraints except the general one about six students. So Lenore could be on any day. If they were both on Tuesday, that's possible, but there's no requirement for Lenore to be on Wednesday. So this pair doesn't have to be on Wednesday.\n\n**B) Helen and Nina**: Let's think.

Since he must report, Tuesday has at least George.\n\n2. **Nina's Day and Implications:**\n   - If Nina reports, the next day must have Helen and Irving. Let's consider Nina's possible days:\n     - **If Nina is on Monday:**\n       - Next day (Tuesday) must have Helen and Irving. But George is already on Tuesday. So, Helen and Irving must both report on Tuesday. However, Tuesday can only have 2 reports (George and someone else). But George is already there, so Helen and Irving would need to split into morning and afternoon, but the problem states \"both Helen and Irving must give reports.\" Wait, does this mean both must report on the same day (Tuesday) or each on their own days? The wording says \"on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports.\" So, if Nina is on Monday, Tuesday must have both Helen and Irving. But George is already on Tuesday. Therefore, Helen and Irving must be the other two reports on Tuesday. However, Tuesday already has George, so Helen and Irving would need to be the morning and afternoon slots. But then, who is left for Wednesday? Let's check:\n         - Monday: Nina (either morning or afternoon)\n         - Tuesday: George, Helen, Irving (but each day has two reports). Wait, this is a problem. Each day has two reports. So if George is on Tuesday, and Helen and Irving must also be on Tuesday, that's three people on Tuesday, which is impossible. Therefore, Nina cannot be on Monday because it would require three people on Tuesday.\n\n     - **If Nina is on Tuesday:**\n       - Next day (Wednesday) must have Helen and Irving. But George is already on Tuesday. So, Wednesday would have Helen and Irving. Let's check:\n         - Monday: Needs two reports (excluding George, Nina, Robert). Possible candidates: Kyle, Lenore, Olivia.\n         - Tuesday: George, Nina (but each day has two reports). Wait, George and Nina would be two people on Tuesday, which fits. But then Robert must be on a different day (Mon or Wed).\n         - Wednesday: Helen and Irving, plus Robert. But Wednesday can only have two reports.

But George is fixed on Tuesday. So Tuesday has George in either morning or afternoon. But wait, condition 2 says Olivia and Robert can't have afternoon reports. So George's day (Tuesday) could be morning or afternoon. However, since Olivia and Robert can't be in the afternoon, their reports must be in the morning.

But George is definitely one of the six, so three others are selected.\n\nWait, the problem says \"exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day.\" So each day has two reports, three days × two = six total. So six students out of eight will report. The other two don't. So George is one of the six, and three others are chosen from the remaining seven (Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, Robert). Wait, the problem lists the eight students as George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. So the other seven are Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, Robert.

So, the organizer needs to select between 5 to 6 works from 9 total. The group has French novels (3), Russian novels (3), French plays (2), and a Russian play (1). The constraints are:\n\n1. No more than four French works. So total French novels + French plays ≤4.\n2. At least three novels (which are French and Russian novels) and at most four.\n3. French novels ≥ Russian novels.\n4. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play isn't.\n\nWe need to determine which of the options A-E must be included in any valid selection. So, the answer is the choice that is necessarily part of every possible valid selection.\n\nLet me break down each requirement and see how they interact.\n\nFirst, the novels are French novels (3) and Russian novels (3). Plays are French plays (2) and Russian play (1).\n\nTotal works to select: 5 or 6.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1. French works (F_N + F_P) ≤4. Since there are 2 French plays, even if they take both, that's 2, so up to 2 French plays. Then French novels can be up to 2 more (since 2+2=4). But wait, French novels are 3 available, so maximum 2 French novels if we take both plays.\n\nBut also, the total French works can't exceed 4. So possible combinations:\n\nIf F_P=2 (both plays), then F_N ≤2 (since 2+2=4). But also, constraint 3 says F_N ≥ R_N. And constraint 2 says total novels (F_N + R_N) is between 3-4.\n\nAlso, constraint 4: if both F_P are selected, then Russian play (R_P) is excluded.\n\nLet me consider possible scenarios based on whether both French plays are selected or not.\n\nCase 1: Both French plays are selected (F_P=2). Then by constraint 4, R_P=0. Also, F_N ≤4 - F_P = 4-2=2. So F_N ≤2. But F_N ≥ R_N. The total novels (F_N + R_N) must be 3 or 4.\n\nSo in this case, possible F_N and R_N:\n\nIf F_N=2, then R_N ≤2. But total novels would be 2 + R_N. To be 3 or 4:\n\nIf total=3: R_N=1. So F_N=2, R_N=1. That's allowed. Then total works selected would be F_N + R_N + F_P = 2+1+2=5. Which is within 5-6. Alternatively, if total novels=4, then R_N=2, but F_N=2, so 2+2=4. Then total works=2+2+2=6. That's allowed.\n\nBut wait, F_N can't exceed 3, but in this case, F_N is limited to 2 because of constraint 1. So possible combinations here.\n\nBut also, the total works selected must be 5 or 6. Let's see:\n\nIn Case 1 (F_P=2, R_P=0):\n\nPossible selections:\n\nOption 1: F_N=2, R_N=1. Total works=2+1+2=5. This is valid. Now, check other constraints. French works: 2+2=4 ≤4. Novels total 3 (okay). F_N=2 ≥ R_N=1 (okay).\n\nOption 2: F_N=2, R_N=2. Total works=2+2+2=6. French works=4 (okay).
