So, we have eight students, and exactly six of them will give reports over three days (Mon, Tue, Wed), two each day. The conditions are a bit complex, but let's break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, the main question is asking which pair of student, if chosen to report on the SAME day, must necessarily report on Wednesday. So even if they could be on other days, given they are paired on the day in question, that day has to be Wednesday.\n\nLet me list out the conditions again to make sure I don't miss any:\n\n1. **Tuesday is the ONLY day George can report.**\n2. **Neither Olivia nor Robertson can give afternoon reports.** Wait, the name here is Robert, right? The students are listed as George, Helen,..., Robert. So maybe a typo, but assuming Robert is correct. So Olivia and Robert can't have afternoon reports.\n3 **If Nina gives an oral report, THEN on the NEXT day Helen AND Irving must BOTH give reports. Unless Nina's REPORT is given ON WEDNESDAY.**\n\nSo, the key here is to figure out which pair, when scheduled on the Same day, forces that day to be Wed.\n\nLet’s consider each option:\n\n**A)George and Lenora** (Lenore, I think the last name is Lenore). Since George can only report on Tuesday (condition 1), if both George and someone else are on Tuesday. But the question is, if both are on the **same day**, must that day be Wednesday? But George can ONLY be on Thursday? Wait, no. Wait, condition 5 says three consecutive weekdays, which are Monday, Tuesday... Wait, original problem says three days: Monday, Tue... Wednesday. Wait the problem states:\n\n\"three consecutive days — Monday,Tuesday and Wednesday.\" So the three days are Monday to Wednesday. But George's only possible day is Tuesday (cond 1). So if George is scheduled on Tuesday with Lenore on Tuesday as well, then that day is Wednesday? Wait no. The days are fixed as Monday, Tues, Wed. So if both G and L are on, say, Tuesday (same day), then that day's reports are Tue. But since G must be there, the day must be Tuesday. So option A's pair would be on a day that must be Wednesday. No, wait. The question is: if the pair is scheduled to report ON the same DAY, then which day must that be Wednesday?\n\nWait, the answer choices are pairs of students. If those two students are scheduled to give reports ON the SAME DAY (i.e., they are both assigned to the same reporting day), which day would that have to be?\n\nSo for example, if George and another student are both scheduled on a particular day, then what day must it be? Since George's reports can only be on Tue, if the other student can be scheduled on any day except maybe some constraints, then if the two are on a same day, that day's assignment must include both. But if George can be there only on Tuesday except if the day is forced to be another. Wait no, George must be scheduled only on Tue. So the only possible days George can have are Tuesday. Therefore, any pair that includes George must have their common day as Tuesday. Because George can't be on any other day. Therefore option A: George and lenore must be both on Tuesday? But the answer is asking for which pair's common day must necessarily be Wednesday, but George can't. So perhaps A is incorrect.\n\nWait, but the question says \"must give reports during Wednesday\" if they are scheduled on Wednesday? No, the question states: \"must be Wednesday\" as the day they give their reports. Wait: \"which one of... is a PAIR of students, if THEY give reports [on] the same [day], must give [reports] on Wednesday?\" So if those two are assigned to a day, and that day must have been Wednesday. Because if they were on Monday or Tuesday, but given their constraints, that would be impossible.

So any pair involving George must include Tuesday. Lenore has no restrictions except she's part of the six students. So unless there's a constraint that Lenore can't be scheduled with George on Tuesday because of something else, but I don't think so. So their common possible day would be Tuesday, not Wednesday.
