The options are A to E.\n\nFirst, let's break down each condition.\n\nStarting with George. Since he can only be on Tuesday, that's fixed. So Tuesday has George either in the morning or afternoon. That leaves one more slot on Tuesday. The other days (Monday and Wednesday) will have two slots each, but only four more students (since six total minus George's one).\n\nNext, Olivia and Robert can't have afternoon reports. So wherever they are scheduled, their reports must be in the morning.

If Nina is on a day, then the next day Helen and Irving must both report. But if Nina is on Wednesday, there's no next day, so the condition doesn't apply. So if Nina is on Monday, Helen and Irving must be on Tuesday. If Nina is on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must be on Wednesday. But since George is already on Tuesday, Helen and Irving could be George's next day, but George is the only one allowed on Tuesday. Wait, no—George is one person. So if Nina is on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must be on Wednesday. But George is also on Tuesday. So Tuesday would have George, Nina, Helen, and Irving? Wait, no. Each day has two slots. So if Nina is on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both be on Wednesday. Because the next day after Tuesday is Wednesday. So if Nina is on Tuesday, Helen and Irving must be on Wednesday.

First, I need to understand all the conditions and constraints given. Let me list them out:\n\n1. **Six students will give reports**: Out of eight (George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, Robert), exactly six will speak. The problem states that George, Nina, and Robert are among these six. So, the other three speakers must be chosen from the remaining four: Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Olivia, but wait—no, wait. Wait, the problem says \"If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another...\" So the six speakers include George, Nina, Robert, and three others. The other three must be selected from the remaining six students (Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Olivia, and the other four? Wait, original list is eight: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, Robert. So six speakers: George, Nina, Robert, and three more from the remaining five (Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Olivia). Wait, no: the remaining would be five, but since exactly six are needed, and three are already George, Nina, Robert, the other three must be selected from Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Olivia. So three of those five.\n\n2. **Three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday**: Each day has two reports: morning and afternoon. So each day has two time slots.\n\n3. **Tuesday is the only day George can give a report**: So George must be on Tuesday. Since each day has two slots, George could be in either morning or afternoon on Tuesday.\n\n4. **Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report**: So wherever Olivia and Robert are scheduled, their reports must be in the morning.\n\n5. **If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday**: So if Nina is on Monday, then Tuesday must have both Helen and Irving. If Nina is on Tuesday, then Wednesday must have both Helen and Irving. If Nina is on Wednesday, this condition doesn't apply.\n\n6. **George, Nina, and Robert give reports and do so on different days**: So each of these three must be on different days. Since there are three days, each of these three must be on a separate day. Therefore, one of them is on Monday, one on Tuesday, and one on Wednesday. But wait, the days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. So each of the three days must have exactly one of these three (George, Nina, Robert), and the other three speakers are on the remaining days. Wait, no: the six speakers include George, Nina, Robert, and three others. The days are three, each with two speakers. So each day must have two speakers. So the three days (Mon, Tue, Wed) each have two speakers. So total six speakers. The three days each have two, so the six speakers are spread across the three days. But the problem states that George, Nina, and Robert are among the six, and they each give reports on different days. So each of these three must be on a different day. Therefore, one of them is on Monday, one on Tuesday, and one on Wednesday. But wait, Tuesday is the only day George can be. So George must be on Tuesday. Therefore, the three (George, Nina, Robert) are each on different days. Since George is on Tuesday, then Nina and Robert must be on Monday and Wednesday. So Nina is on either Monday or Wednesday, Robert on the other. Then the third speaker (from the remaining three) must be on the remaining day. Wait, let's see:\n\nWait, the six speakers are spread over three days, two per day. So each day has two speakers. The three days are Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. The three people (George, Nina, Robert) must each be on different days. So:\n\n- George is on Tuesday (since he can't be elsewhere).\n\n- Therefore, Nina and Robert must be on Monday and Wednesday (one each).\n\n- The remaining three speakers (from Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Olivia) must be on the remaining days. Wait, but each day already has two speakers. Wait, no: each day has two speakers. So:\n\nIf George is on Tuesday (either morning or afternoon), then Tuesday has one speaker (George) and one other. Wait, no: each day has two speakers. So Tuesday has two speakers: George and someone else.

{"id":"ar_lsat_200010_3-G_1_5","question":"Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.

So, we have eight students, and exactly six will give reports over three days: Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Each day has two reports—morning and afternoon. The conditions are a bit complex, so I need to break them down one by one.\n\nFirst, the days are consecutive with two reports each day. So total six reports. Now, let's list out all the conditions given:\n\n1. **Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.** So George must be giving on Tuesday. That means his report is either morning or afternoon on Tuesday. But we need to check other constraints to see where exactly.\n\n2. **Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.** So on each day, the afternoon slot cannot be Olivia or Robert. Their reports, if any, must be in the morning.\n\n3. **If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is on Wednesday.** So if Nina is on a day, the next day (Monday to Tuesday, Tuesday to Wednesday) must have both Helen and Irving. But if Nina is on Wednesday, there's no restriction because there's no day after Wednesday.\n\n4. **Kyle gives the afternoon report on Tuesday.** So on Tuesday afternoon, it's Kyle. That means Tuesday's afternoon is fixed as Kyle. Therefore, Tuesday's morning must be someone else. Also, since Kyle is giving an afternoon report, he's not restricted from other days, but we know he's on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n5. **Helen gives the afternoon report on Wednesday.** So Wednesday afternoon is Helen. Therefore, Helen is giving an afternoon report, which is allowed because the only restriction is Olivia and Robert can't do afternoon. Helen is fine here.\n\nNow, let's start piecing this together.\n\n**Tuesday's Schedule:**\n- Afternoon: Kyle (fixed)\n- Morning: Needs to be someone. Since George can only be on Tuesday, and the morning of Tuesday is open. But also, we have to check if George is in the morning or afternoon. Since Kyle is already in the afternoon, George could be in the morning. But wait, George can only be on Tuesday. So Tuesday's morning could be George or someone else. However, we need to check if there's any conflict. Let's hold that thought.\n\n**Wednesday's Schedule:**\n- Afternoon: Helen (fixed)\n- Morning: Needs to be someone. Also, Helen is in the afternoon, so if Helen is in the afternoon, that's her only report. But the morning on Wednesday is open. Also, since Helen is in the afternoon, if Nina was on Tuesday, then the next day (Wednesday) must have Helen and Irving. Wait, but Helen is already on Wednesday. So if Nina was on Tuesday, then Wednesday must have Helen and Irving. But Helen is already there, so maybe that's okay. But if Nina is on Wednesday, there's no restriction. Let's see.\n\n**George's Schedule:**\n- Only on Tuesday. So George must be either morning or afternoon on Tuesday. But Tuesday afternoon is Kyle, so George must be in the morning on Tuesday. So Tuesday's morning is George. Wait, but let's check if that's possible.\n\nWait, but the answer choices have different options for Tuesday's morning. Let's check the answer choices given. The options for Tuesday's morning are:\n\nA) Irving\nB) Lenore\nC) Nina\nD) Robert\nE) Robert\n\nSo if George is on Tuesday morning, that's not among the options. Wait, this is a problem. The answer choices for Tuesday's morning don't include George. Hmm. Wait, but according to the problem, George can only be on Tuesday. So the Tuesday morning must be George. But none of the answer choices have George. Wait, that's impossible. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nWait, the problem states that exactly six students will give reports. So six students in total. The answer choices list possible combinations for the morning reports on each day. Each answer choice lists three names for Monday morning, Tuesday morning, and Wednesday morning. So each answer choice is a possible set of three people giving the morning reports on the three days. The afternoon reports would then be the remaining three students (since six total, each day two reports).\n\nWait, but the problem says \"exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
