How many apples does Adam have?\n\nSolution:  \n1. Jackie's apples = 9  \n2. Adam's apples = Jackie's apples + 5 = 9 + 5 = 14  \n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{14}<think>\nOkay, let's see here. The problem says Adam has five more apples than Jackie, and Jackie has nine apples. I need to find out how many apples Adam has. Alright, so first, let's break this down. \n\nJackie's apples are given directly as 9. Now, Adam has five more than that. The phrase \"five more than\" usually means addition, right? So if Jackie has 9, then Adam would have 9 plus 5. Let me write that out: Adam's apples = Jackie's apples + 5. Plugging in the numbers, that's 9 + 5. Hmm, 9 plus 5 is... let me count. 9 plus 1 is 10, then 5 more would be 10 + 4 = 14. Wait, no, that's if I break it down. Alternatively, 9 + 1 is 10, so 9 + 5 is 10 + 3 - 1? No, wait, that's complicating it. Straight addition: 9 + 5. 9 plus 5 is 14. Yeah, that's right. \n\nLet me check again to make sure I didn't misread. The problem says \"five more apples than Jackie.\" Since Jackie has 9, adding five gives Adam's total. Yep, that seems correct. No subtraction or multiplication needed here. Just simple addition. So 9 + 5 equals 14. Therefore, Adam has 14 apples. I think that's the answer. No complicated steps here. Straightforward problem. Just making sure I interpreted \"five more than\" correctly. Yeah, that's addition. Okay, confident with 14 as the answer.\n</async>\n\n<think>\n\nProblem: Adam has five more apples than Jackie. Jackie has nine apples.
