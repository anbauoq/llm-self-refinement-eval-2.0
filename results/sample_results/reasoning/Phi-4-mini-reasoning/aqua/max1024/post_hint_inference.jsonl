{"id":8,"question":"Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session?\n# Answer option: ['A)27', 'B)81', 'C)90', 'D)99', 'E)110']","chain_of_thought":"Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the maximum number of students who neither attended the prom nor joined the debating session. The school has 200 students. We know that at least 45% attended the prom and at least 35% participated in the debating session. We need to maximize the number of students who did neither, which means we have to minimize the number of students who attended at least one event.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the minimum number of students that must have attended each event. For the prom, 45% of 200 is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. For the debating session, 35% of 200 is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students. So, there are at least 90 students in the prom group and 70 in the debating group.\n\nNow, to find the minimum number of students who attended either event, we need to consider the maximum possible overlap between these two groups. The more overlap there is, the fewer unique students there will be in total. The maximum possible overlap can't exceed the size of the smaller group. Since the debating group is smaller (70 students), the maximum overlap is 70. That means all 70 students in the debating group also attended the prom.\n\nSo, if all 70 debating students are already counted in the 90 prom attendees, then the total number of unique students who attended at least one event is 90 (prom) + 70 (debating) - 70 (overlap) = 90 students. \n\nSubtracting this from the total number of students gives 200 - 90 = 110 students who didn't attend either event. Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debating session is 110. That corresponds to option E.","full_output":"<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step.

The largest possible overlap is the size of the smaller group (70 students). Thus, all 70 debating students are also prom attendees.  \n\nThe total number of unique students who attended at least one event is:  \n\\[\n90 \\, (\\text{prom}) + 70 \\, (\\text{debating}) - 70 \\, (\\text{overlap}) = 90.\n\\]  \n\nSubtracting this from the total number of students gives the maximum number who attended neither:  \n\\[\n200 - 90 = 110.\n\\]  \n\n**Final Answer**: \\boxed{E}<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of students who neither went to the prom nor joined the debating session. There are 200 students in total. The given percentages are at least 45% for prom and at least 35% for debating. So, I need to figure out the worst-case scenario where as many students as possible did both events, leaving the least number of students who did at least one.\n\nFirst, I need to convert the percentages to actual numbers. 45% of 200 is 0.45 times 200, which is 90 students minimum for prom. 35% is 0.35 times 200, which is 70 students minimum for debating. So, the minimum number of students in each group is 90 and 70. \n\nNow, to minimize the total number of students who attended either event, I should maximize the overlap between the two groups. The more overlap there is, the fewer unique students there will be in total. The maximum possible overlap can't exceed the size of the smaller group. Since the debating group is smaller (70 students), the maximum overlap is 70. That means all 70 debating students are also prom attendees.\n\nSo, if all 70 debating students are already counted in the 90 prom attendees, then the total number of unique students who attended at least one event is 90 plus 70 minus 70, which is 90 students. \n\nSubtracting this from the total number of students gives 200 minus 90, which equals 110 students who didn't attend either event. Therefore, the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom nor the debating session is 110. That corresponds to option E.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If there are 90 students in prom and 70 in debating, and all 70 debating are in the prom group, then the total is indeed 90. So 200 minus 90 is 110. Yeah, that seems right. The key here is assuming the maximum overlap, which minimizes the total number of students in either event.","ground_truth":"E","predicted_answer":"A","is_correct":false,"from_retry":false}
