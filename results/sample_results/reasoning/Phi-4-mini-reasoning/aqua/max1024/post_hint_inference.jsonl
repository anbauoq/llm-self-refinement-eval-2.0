{"id":3,"question":"If the probability that Stock A will increase in value during the next month is 0.56, and the probability that Stock B will increase in value during the next month is 0.74. What is the greatest value for the probability that neither of these two events will occur?\n# Answer option: ['A)0.22', 'B)0.26', 'C)0.37', 'D)0.46', 'E)0.63']","chain_of_thought":"<think>\nOkay, so I need to find the greatest value for the probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B increases in value next month. Let me think about how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I remember that the probability of neither event happening is the complement of at least one event happening. So maybe I should use the principle of inclusion-exclusion here. Let me recall the formula.\n\nThe probability that neither A nor B happens is equal to 1 minus the probability that A happens or B happens. In symbols: P(not A and not B) = 1 - P(A ∨ B). And P(A ∨ B) is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Right.\n\nBut wait, the problem says \"the greatest value for the probability that neither will occur.\" To maximize P(neither), I need to minimize P(A ∨ B), since it's 1 minus that. So how do I minimize P(A ∨ B)? Well, the minimum value of P(A ∨ B) occurs when P(A and B) is as large as possible. Because P(A ∨ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). So the smaller P(A and B) is, the larger P(A ∨ B) becomes, which would make 1 - P(A ∨ B) smaller. Wait, but we want to maximize P(neither), which is 1 - P(A ∨ B). Therefore, to maximize that, we need to minimize P(A ∨ B). Which in turn requires maximizing P(A and B). \n\nBut the maximum possible value of P(A and B) is the smaller of the two individual probabilities, right? Because the probability that both occur can't be more than the probability of either one occurring alone. Since Stock A has a probability of 0.56 and Stock B has 0.74, the maximum possible P(A and B) is 0.56. Because if A occurs, B can occur only if A and B are dependent in such a way. Wait, actually, the maximum possible overlap between A and B is the minimum of the two probabilities. So if the events are as correlated as possible, then P(A and B) can be as high as 0.56. So if they are perfectly correlated, then whenever A happens, B also happens, so P(A and B) = 0.56. Then P(A ∨ B) would be 0.74 + 0.56 - 0.56 = 0.74. Therefore, P(neither) would be 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. But wait, is that correct?\n\nAlternatively, if the events are as disjoint as possible, then P(A and B) would be minimized, which would make P(A ∨ B) as large as possible, leading to the smallest P(neither). But since we want the maximum P(neither), we need the minimum P(A ∨ B), which requires the maximum P(A and B). So the maximum possible P(neither) is when P(A and B) is as large as possible. Therefore, the maximum P(neither) is 1 - [P(A) + P(B) - min(P(A), P(B))]. Since P(B) is higher here (0.74), so min(P(A), P(B)) is 0.56. Therefore, P(A ∨ B) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.56 = 0.74. Therefore, P(neither) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. So the answer would be B) 0.26.\n\nWait, but let me check. Let's suppose that the two events are independent. Then P(A and B) would be 0.56 * 0.74 = 0.4144. Then P(A ∨ B) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.4144 = 0.8856. Then P(neither) would be 1 - 0.8856 = 0.1144. But that's a lower value. So in the case of independence, the probability that neither occurs is lower. But if the events are as dependent as possible (i.e., whenever A occurs, B also occurs), then P(A and B) = P(A) = 0.56, so P(A ∨ B) = 0.74, leading to P(neither) = 0.26. So that's higher. So the maximum possible probability that neither occurs is 0.26. Therefore, the answer is B.\n\nBut wait, let me think again. The maximum possible value of P(neither) would occur when the overlap between A and B is as large as possible. Because that reduces the union.
