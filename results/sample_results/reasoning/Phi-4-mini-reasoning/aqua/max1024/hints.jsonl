{"id":8,"question":"Of the 200 students in a school, at least 45% attended the prom night and at least 35% took part in the debating session. What is the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor the debating session?\n# Answer option: ['A)27', 'B)81', 'C)90', 'D)99', 'E)110']","chain_of_thought":"<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have 200 students in total. The question is asking for the maximum number of students who could have neither attended the prom night nor participated in the debating session. Hmm, to find the maximum number of students who didn't do either, we need to minimize the number of students who did at least one of the activities. Wait, right. Because the more students that did at least one activity, the fewer are left out. So to maximize the ones who did neither, we need the minimum overlap between the two groups.\n\nAlright, the problem states that at least 45% attended the prom and at least 35% took part in the debating session. So, the minimum number of students who attended the prom is 45% of 200. Let me calculate that: 0.45 * 200 = 90 students. Similarly, the minimum for debating is 35% of 200, which is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students.\n\nNow, if we want the minimum number of students who did either prom or debating, we need to consider the overlap. The principle here is the inclusion-exclusion principle: the number who did either is equal to the number who did prom plus the number who did debating minus those who did both. But since we want to minimize the total (to maximize those who did neither), we need to maximize the overlap. Wait, no. Wait, to minimize the total number who did either, we need the maximum possible overlap. Because if as many students as possible did both, then the total number is prom + debating - both. So if both is as large as possible, then the total is minimized.\n\nSo the maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two groups. Because you can't have more students who did both activities than the number in each group. So the maximum overlap here would be the smaller of 90 and 70, which is 70. So if all 70 students in the debating group also attended the prom, then the total number of students who did either would be 90 (prom) + 70 (debating) - 70 (both) = 90. \n\nWait, let me check that again. If all 70 debating students are included in the 90 prom attendees, then the total is 90 + 70 - 70 = 90. So the total number who did either is 90. Therefore, the number who did neither is 200 - 90 = 110. But wait, 110 is one of the options (option E). But wait, the answer choices are A)27, B)81, C)90, D)99, E)110.\n\nBut hold on, maybe I made a mistake here. Let's re-examine. The problem states \"at least 45%\" attended the prom and \"at least 35%\" took part in debating. So the actual numbers could be higher than 45% and 35%, but we need the maximum possible number who did neither, which would occur when the actual numbers are exactly 45% and 35%, because if they were higher, then the number who did neither would be even less. So we can take the minimum required numbers to compute the maximum possible neither.\n\nSo, using 90 and 70. Then, as above, the maximum overlap is 70 (since debating is 70). So total in either is 90 + 70 - 70 = 90. Therefore, neither is 200 - 90 = 110. But option E is 110, which would be the answer. But wait, the options include 110. But let me check again. Wait, maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, 45% of 200 is 90, 35% is 70. So the minimum number in prom is 90, minimum in debating is 70. To find the maximum number who did neither, we need the minimum number who did at least one. To get the minimum number who did at least one, we maximize the overlap. The maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two numbers, which is 70. So total in either is 90 + 70 - 70 = 90. Therefore, the maximum number who did neither is 200 - 90 = 110. So the answer should be E)110.\n\nBut wait, let me check with another approach. Let's use the formula: neither = total - (A + B - both). To maximize neither, we need to minimize (A + B - both). The smallest possible value of (A + B - both) is when both is as large as possible. The maximum possible both is the minimum of A and B. Here, A is 90, B is 70. So maximum both is 70. Therefore, minimum (A + B - both) is 90 + 70 -70 = 90. Therefore, neither is 200 -90 = 110","full_output":"<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, we have 200 students in total.

The formula for students participating in at least one event is the sum of participants minus the overlap. Maximizing overlap minimizes this sum, thereby maximizing those who did neither. Use the minimum percentages to find the smallest possible participants in each event and assume the maximum overlap.\n</hint><think>\n\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about finding the maximum number of students who neither went to the prom nor joined the debating session. There are 200 students in total. The given percentages are at least 45% for prom and at least 35% for debating. So, I need to figure out the worst-case scenario where as many students as possible did both events, leaving the least number of students who did at least one. Then subtract that from the total to get the maximum neither.\n\nFirst, let's convert the percentages to actual numbers. 45% of 200 is 0.45 * 200 = 90 students minimum for prom. 35% is 0.35 * 200 = 70 students minimum for debating. So, the smallest number of students who attended prom is 90, and the smallest for debating is 70. But since we want the maximum number who did neither, we need the minimum number who did either. \n\nTo minimize the number of students who did either event, we should maximize the overlap between the two groups. The maximum possible overlap is the smaller of the two numbers because you can't have more students in both events than the number in the smaller group. Here, the debating group is smaller (70 vs. 90), so the maximum overlap is 70. That means all 70 debating students also attended the prom. \n\nSo, the total number of students who attended at least one event would be the number who attended prom plus the number who attended debating minus those who attended both (to avoid double-counting). That would be 90 + 70 - 70 = 90 students. Therefore, the maximum number of students who did neither is 200 - 90 = 110. \n\nWait, but let me check if that's correct. If all 70 in debating are already in the 90 prom attendees, then adding the 70 doesn't increase the total. So the total becomes 90. Then subtracting from 200 gives 110. That makes sense. But what if the percentages were higher? But since the problem states \"at least\" those percentages, using the minimum gives the maximum possible neither. If more students attended the events, then the neither would be smaller. So yes, using 45% and 35% gives the maximum possible neither. So the answer should be 110, which is option E. \n\nWait, but let me think again. Suppose the actual numbers were higher than 45% and 35%, like 50% and 40%. Then the total would be higher, leading to fewer neither. But since the problem asks for the maximum possible neither, we have to assume the minimum required by the problem's constraints. So using 45% and 35% is correct. Therefore, the calculation should be correct. So the answer is E)110.\n\n</think>\n\nTo determine the maximum number of students who participated in neither event, first calculate the minimum number of participants for each event using the given percentages. For prom: \\(45\\% \\times 200 = 90\\) students, and for debating: \\(35\\% \\times 200 = 70\\) students. To minimize the total number of students who attended at least one event, maximize the overlap between the two groups. The maximum overlap is limited by the smaller group (70 students). Using the inclusion-exclusion principle:  \n\\[\n\\text{Total in either event} = 90 + 70 - 70 = 90\n\\]\nSubtracting this from the total number of students gives the maximum number who participated in neither:  \n\\[\n200 - 90 = 110\n\\]\n\n\\boxed{E}<think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is asking for the maximum number of students who neither attended the prom nor the debating session. There are 200 students in total.
