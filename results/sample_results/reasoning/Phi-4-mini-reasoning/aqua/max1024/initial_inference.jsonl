The problem is to find the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 10. Hmm, first I need to make sure I understand the question correctly. So, even numbers are numbers divisible by 2, right? Let me list out the numbers between 1 and 10. That would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Now, the even ones in this range are the numbers that when divided by 2 give an integer.

Let me parse the question carefully.\n\nThe question says: \"Find out which of the following values is the multiple of X, if it is divisible by 9 and 12?\" Wait, that's a bit confusing. Let me rephrase it. So, X is a number that is divisible by both 9 and 12. Therefore, X must be a common multiple of 9 and 12. But the question is asking which of the options is a multiple of X. So, the options are numbers, and we need to find which one is divisible by X, given that X is the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12, or maybe any common multiple. Wait, but the problem says \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12\"—so X is the LCM of 9 and 12, right?\n\nFirst, let's find the LCM of 9 and 12. To do that, I can factor both numbers. 9 is 3², and 12 is 2²×3. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes present, so that would be 2²×3² = 4×9 = 36. So X is 36.

All other options are numbers like 15, 17, etc., which are primes or not multiples of 36. So the answer should be A)36. But wait, let me confirm. The problem says \"the multiple of X\", so X is 36, so the multiple would be 36, 72, 108, etc. Among the options, only 36 is present, so A is correct. But maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Wait, the question says \"if it is divisible by 9 and 12\"—so X is the LCM of 9 and 12, which is 36. Therefore, the multiple of X must be 36, 72, etc. Among the options, only 36 is present. So the answer is A)36. The other options are not divisible by 9 or 12. For example, 15: 15 ÷ 9 is not an integer. 17 is prime. 5 and 7 are primes.

The question is asking which of the given options is a multiple of X, where X is divisible by both 9 and 12. Hmm, first I need to figure out what X is. Since X has to be divisible by 9 and 12, that means X must be a common multiple of these two numbers. The smallest such number is the least common multiple (LCM) of 9 and 12. Let me calculate that.\n\nSo, breaking down 9 into prime factors: 9 is 3 squared, which is 3^2. For 12, the prime factors are 2 squared times 3, so 2^2 * 3. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all primes involved. That would be 2^2 from 12 and 3^2 from 9. Multiplying those together gives 4 * 9 = 36. Therefore, X must be 36, right?

The problem is about finding the cost price when the selling price is given along with a profit percentage. Hmm. I remember that profit percentage is calculated based on the cost price. So if someone sells something with a 20% profit, that means the selling price is 120% of the cost price. \n\nLet me write down the formula to be clear. Profit percentage is [(SP - CP)/CP] * 100. In this case, the profit is 20%, so:\n\n20% = (360 - CP)/CP * 100\n\nWait, maybe rearranging the formula would be better. Since SP is CP plus 20% of CP, that would be SP = CP + 0.20*CP = 1.20*CP. So to find CP, we can divide the SP by 1.20. \n\nSo CP = 360 / 1.20. Let me calculate that. 360 divided by 1.2. Hmm, 1.2 times 300 is 360 because 1.2*300 = 360. So CP must be 300. That makes sense. \n\nLet me check if there's another way to approach it. Suppose the cost price is 100%, then the selling price is 120%. If 120% is 360, then 10% would be 360/12 = 30. So 100% would be 30*10 = 300. Yep, same result. \n\nI don't think there's any trick here. The answer should be 300, which is option B. No other options make sense. If I thought the profit was added to the CP instead of calculated on it, maybe I'd get confused, but the standard formula uses profit based on CP. So I'm confident the answer is B.","full_output":"<think>\n\nOkay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the question is about finding the cost price of an article that was sold with a 20% profit, and the selling price is Rs.360. Alright, I need to remember the basic formulas related to profit and cost price.\n\nFirst, I recall that when there's a profit percentage, the selling price is calculated based on the cost price plus the profit. The formula I think is: Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (CP) × (1 + Profit Percentage/100). In this case, the profit is 20%, so the SP should be CP multiplied by 1.20.\n\nThe problem gives SP as Rs.360, and we need to find CP. So rearranging the formula, CP would be SP divided by (1 + Profit Percentage/100). Plugging in the numbers, that's 360 divided by 1.20. Let me do that calculation. \n\nWait, 1.20 times what gives 360? Let me see. 1.2 times 300 is 360, right? Because 1.2 times 300: 300 × 1 = 300, 300 × 0.2 = 60, so total 360. So that would mean the cost price is 300. So the answer should be option B) 300.\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. Another way to think about it is: if the profit is 20%, then the selling price is 120% of the cost price. So 120% corresponds to 360. To find 100%, which is the CP, we divide 360 by 120 and multiply by 100. So (360 / 120) × 100 = 3 × 100 = 300. Yep, that's the same result. So the cost price is indeed Rs.300. So the correct option is B.\n\nI don't think there are any other factors here. The problem seems straightforward with a direct application of the profit percentage formula. No discounts or taxes involved here. Just basic profit and loss calculation. So I'm confident that B) 300 is the right answer.\n\n</think>\n\n<think>\nTo determine the cost price (CP) when the selling price (SP) is Rs. 360 with a 20% profit:  \n**SP = CP × (1 + 20/100)**  \n**CP = SP / 1.20**  \n**CP = 360 / 1.20 = 300**  \n\nThe cost price of the article is **300**, corresponding to option B.  \n\n<ans>B</ans><think>\nOkay, let's see.

In this case, the profit is 20%, so:\n\n20% = (360 - CP)/CP * 100\n\nWait, maybe rearranging the formula would be better. Since SP is CP plus 20% of CP, that would be SP = CP + 0.20*CP = 1.20*CP. So to find CP, we can divide the SP by 1.20. \n\nSo CP = 360 / 1.20. Let me calculate that. 360 divided by 1.2. Hmm, 1.2 times 300 is 360 because 1.2*300 = 360. So CP must be 300. That makes sense. \n\nLet me check if there's another way to approach it. Suppose the cost price is 100%, then the selling price is 120%. If 120% is 360, then 10% would be 360/12 = 30. So 100% would be 30*10 = 300. Yep, same result. \n\nI don't think there's any trick here. The answer should be 300, which is option B. No other options make sense. If I thought the profit was added to the CP instead of calculated on it, maybe I'd get confused, but the standard formula uses profit based on CP. So I'm confident the answer is B.\n</think>\n\nTo find the cost price (CP) when the selling price (SP) is Rs. 360 with a 20% profit:  \n- Profit percentage formula: \\( \\text{SP} = \\text{CP} \\times (1 + \\frac{\\text{Profit \\%}}{100}) \\)  \n- Substituting values: \\( 360 = \\text{CP} \\times 1.20 \\)  \n- Solving for CP: \\( \\text{CP} = \\frac{360}{","ground_truth":"B","predicted_answer":"B","is_correct":true,"from_retry":false}

Let me start by recalling what a prime factor is. A prime factor is a factor of a number that is a prime number. For example, the prime factors of 15 are 3 and 5 because 15 = 3 × 5, and both 3 and 5 are primes.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how to break down each number in the set into its prime factors. Then, I have to collect all the unique ones and sum them up. Let me think about the steps involved here.\n\nLet me take an example to make it concrete. Suppose the set is {12, 18, 24}. Let's break each down:\n\n- 12: The prime factors are 2 and 3 (since 12 = 2² × 3).\n- 18: The prime factors are 2 and 3 (18 = 2 × 3²).\n- 24: The prime factors are 2 and 3 (24 = 2³ × 3).\n\nSo the unique primes here are 2 and 3. Their sum is 2 + 3 = 5. That makes sense.\n\nBut what if the numbers have different prime factors? Let's try another example.

Let's think. For a given number n, start dividing by the smallest primes (2, 3, 5, etc.) and continue until the number is reduced to 1. For example, factorizing 18:\n\n18 divided by 2 is 9. Then 9 divided by 3 is 3, then divided by 3 again is 1. So primes are 2 and 3.\n\nAnother example: 17. Since 17 is a prime, its prime factorization is just 17 itself.\n\nSo, for each number, I need to check divisibility starting from 2 up to the square root of the number. If a divisor is found, include it in the factors and divide the number by that divisor, repeating the process.

So, the question is about forming bike numbers that consist of 2 letters followed by 2 numbers. The key part here is that the letters need to be distinct. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how many possible combinations there are for each part of the bike number and then multiply them together because each part is independent. \n\nStarting with the letters: The bike number uses 2 letters. Since they have to be distinct, I can't repeat the same letter twice. The English alphabet has 26 letters. For the first letter, there are 26 choices. Once the first letter is chosen, the second letter has to be different, so there are 25 choices left. So, the number of possible combinations for the letters part should be 26 multiplied by 25. Let me write that down: 26 * 25. Let me calculate that. 25 times 20 is 500, and 25 times 6 is 150, so 500 + 150 = 650. So, 650 combinations for the letters.\n\nNext, the numbers part: It's two digits. Each digit can be from 0 to 9, and I assume they can repeat because the problem doesn't say they can't. So for each of the two digits, there are 10 possibilities. Therefore, the number of combinations for the numbers is 10 multiplied by 10, which is 100. \n\nNow, to get the total number of distinct bike numbers, I multiply the number of letter combinations by the number of number combinations. That's 650 * 100. Let me compute that. 650 times 100 is straightforward—it adds two zeros, so 65,000. \n\nLooking at the options provided: D is 65,000. The other options are different numbers, like 65,443 or 74,353, which don't match my calculation. Let me just double-check my reasoning. \n\nLetters: 26 * 25 = 650. That's correct because the first letter has 26 options and the second has 25. Numbers: 10 * 10 = 100. Multiplying them gives 65,000. Hmm, seems right. The problem says \"distinct\" letters, so no repetition there. The numbers can be any digits, even if they repeat, since the question only specifies that the letters need to be distinct.

So, the question is about a train whose total journey time changes because of a speed reduction due to rain. Let me parse the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the original scenario: The train runs at 100 mph and takes 10 hours to reach its destination. That means the total distance is speed multiplied by time, right? So 100 mph * 10 hours = 1000 miles. Wait, that seems like a long distance, but maybe that's correct. Let me confirm. Yes, if you go 100 miles every hour for 10 hours, the total distance is indeed 1000 miles.\n\nBut then, after covering a quarter of the distance, it starts raining. So the first part is the first quarter of the journey, and the remaining three-quarters are at the reduced speed. Let me break this down.\n\nTotal distance is 1000 miles. A quarter of that is 250 miles. So the train travels the first 250 miles at 100 mph. Then the remaining 750 miles (since 1000 - 250 = 750) at 75 mph. We need to find out how much time each part takes and sum them up for the total journey duration.\n\nLet's calculate the time for the first part. Time equals distance divided by speed. So for the first segment: 250 miles / 100 mph = 2.5 hours. That makes sense because at 100 mph, each hour covers 100 miles, so 250 miles would take 2.5 hours.\n\nNow the second part: 750 miles at 75 mph. Time here would be 750 / 75. Let me compute that. 75 goes into 750 ten times, right? 75*10 = 750. So that's 10 hours.\n\nAdding both parts together: 2.5 hours + 10 hours = 12.5 hours. So the total journey duration is 12.5 hours. Looking at the options, option C is 12.5. So the answer should be C.\n\nWait, but let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let's verify each step again.\n\nTotal distance: 100 mph * 10 hours = 1000 miles. Correct.\n\nFirst quarter: 1000 / 4 = 250 miles. Correct.\n\nTime for first part: 250 / 100 = 2.5 hours. Correct.\n\nRemaining distance: 1000 - 250 = 750 miles. Correct.\n\nSpeed after rain: 75 mph. Time: 750 / 75 = 10 hours. Correct.\n\nTotal time: 2.5 + 10 = 12.5. Yes, that's right. So option C is the correct answer.\n\nHmm, but wait, the original problem says \"total journey duration\". The original duration was 10 hours at 100 mph. But since part of the journey is slower, the time should be longer than 10 hours. Since 12.5 is longer, that's logical. The options include C)12.5, which matches our calculation.

Let me check that: 100 mph * 10 hours = 1000 miles. Yep, that's the total distance.\n\nBut then, after covering a quarter of the distance, it slows down. A quarter of 1000 miles is 250 miles.

The problem is to find the sum of all even integers in the range from 1 to 101 inclusive. Hmm, so first, I need to make sure I understand the question correctly. Even integers between 1 and 101, including both 1 and 101. Wait, but 1 is odd, right? So the first even integer would be 2, and the last one would be 100, since 101 is odd. So I need to sum all even numbers from 2 up to 100.\n\nAlright, so this seems like an arithmetic series problem. The formula for the sum of an arithmetic series is n/2 times (first term plus last term), where n is the number of terms. Let me recall that formula: S = n/2 * (a₁ + aₙ). So I need to find how many even numbers there are between 2 and 100 inclusive, then apply the formula.\n\nFirst, let's confirm the first term and the last term. First even integer is 2, last even integer is 100. Correct. Now, the common difference between consecutive even numbers is 2. So the number of terms can be calculated by taking the difference between the last and first term, dividing by the common difference, and adding 1. So n = ((100 - 2)/2) + 1. Let me compute that: (98/2) +1 = 49 +1 = 50. So there are 50 terms.\n\nWait, let me check that again. If I have numbers from 2 to 100 stepping by 2, then the count is (100 - 2)/2 +1.

Let's compute that. 25 times 100 is 2500, and 25 times 2 is 50, so total is 2500 +50 = 2550. Therefore, the sum should be 2550.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another approach. Maybe using the formula for the sum of the first m even numbers. The sum of the first m even integers is m*(m+1). Wait, is that right? Wait, the first even number is 2, which is 2*1. The second is 4=2*2, up to the mth term which is 2m. So the sum would be 2*(1+2+...+m) = 2*(m(m+1)/2) = m(m+1). So if the last term is 100, which is 2m, then m=50. So the sum would be 50*51=2550. Yes, same result. So that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2550. Let me just make sure there's no mistake in the range. The problem says from 1 to 101 inclusive. So 1 is included, but it's odd. The even numbers start at 2 and end at 100. So yes, that's correct. If the user had said \"from 1 to 101 inclusive, sum all even numbers\", then 2 to 100 is correct.

Let's compute that. 25 times 100 is 2500, and 25 times 2 is 50, so total is 2500 +50 = 2550. Therefore, the sum should be 2550.\n\nWait, but let me verify with another approach. Maybe using the formula for the sum of the first m even numbers. The sum of the first m even integers is m*(m+1). Wait, is that right? Wait, the first even number is 2, which is 2*1. The second is 4=2*2, up to the mth term which is 2m. So the sum would be 2*(1+2+...+m) = 2*(m(m+1)/2) = m(m+1). So if the last term is 100, which is 2m, then m=50. So the sum would be 50*51=2550. Yes, same result. So that confirms it.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be 2550. Let me just make sure there's no mistake in the range. The problem says from 1 to 101 inclusive. So 1 is included, but it's odd. The even numbers start at 2 and end at 100. So yes, that's correct. If the user had said \"from 1 to 101 inclusive, sum all even numbers\", then 2 to 100 is correct. So everything checks out. The answer is 2550.","predicted_answer":null,"ground_truth":"E","is_correct":null,"from_retry":false}

The problem is about a salesperson who needs to earn at least $1000 in salary. He gets a 10% commission on each sale. Each sale is $250. The question is asking how many such sales he must make to reach that salary.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the information. So, the commission per sale is 10% of $250. Let me calculate that. 10% of 250 is 0.10 * 250, which equals $25. So, for each sale he makes, he earns $25.\n\nNow, he needs a total salary of at least $1000. Let's denote the number of sales he needs as 'n'. Each sale gives $25, so total earnings would be 25 * n. We need this to be at least 1000. So the equation is 25n ≥ 1000.\n\nTo find 'n', divide both sides by 25. 1000 divided by 25 is 40. So n ≥ 40. Wait, but let me check that. 25 times 40 is exactly 1000. So he needs to make 40 sales to reach exactly $1000. But the question says \"at least\" $1000. So if he makes 40 sales, he gets exactly 1000, which meets the requirement. Therefore, the minimum number of sales needed is 40.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 40. So the answer should be D. But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me recheck the math.\n\nCommission per sale: 10% of 250 is indeed 25. Total required is 1000. 1000 divided by 25 is 40. Yes, that's correct. So 40 sales give exactly 1000. Since the requirement is \"at least\" 1000, 40 is the minimum. So the answer is D)40.\n\nWait, but let me check the options again. The options are A)15, B)24, C)25, D)40, E)52. So 40 is option D. So yes, that's correct.\n\nHmm, but maybe I should consider if there's any rounding involved. For example, if the commission per sale was a fraction, but here it's exactly 25. So no, it's straightforward. So 40 is the right answer. So the answer is D.\n\n</think>\n\n<think>\nTo determine the minimum number of $250 sales needed for a salary of at least $1000:  \n1. **Commission per sale**: 10% of $250 = $25.  \n2. **Total required**: $1000.  \n3. **Equation**: \\( 25n \\geq 1000 \\).  \n4. **Solve**: \\( n \\geq \\frac{1000}{25} = 40 \\).  \n\nSince 40 sales yield exactly $1000, which meets the \"at least\" requirement, the answer is **40**.  \n\n</think>\n\n<ans>D</ans><think>\nOkay, let's see. The problem is about a salesperson who needs to earn at least $1000 in salary. They get a 10% commission on each sale, and each sale is $250. I need to find out how many such sales they need to make. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I should figure out how much commission they make per sale. A 10% commission on $250. To calculate that, I can multiply 250 by 10% (or 0.10). So, 250 * 0.10 equals $25. Right, so each sale gives them $25.\n\nNow, they need a total salary of at least $1000. Let's call the number of sales they need to make \"n\". Each sale adds $25, so the total commission would be 25 * n. We need this total to be greater than or equal to $1000. So the inequality is 25n ≥ 1000.\n\nTo find n, I divide both sides of the inequality by 25. That gives n ≥ 1000 / 25. Let me calculate that. 1000 divided by 25 is 40. So n has to be at least 40. \n\nWait, but the options include 40 as option D. So does that mean the answer is D? Let me double-check. If they make 40 sales, each giving $25, then 40 * 25 = 1000 exactly. Since the problem says \"at least\" $1000, 40 is the minimum number needed. So yes, 40 is correct. \n\nI don't think there's any trick here. The math seems straightforward. Maybe I can check with another number. If they made 39 sales, that would be 39 * 25 = 975, which is less than","ground_truth":"D","predicted_answer":"D","is_correct":true,"from_retry":false}
