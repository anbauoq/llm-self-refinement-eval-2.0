So the problem is about Wendi feeding her chickens. Each chicken gets three cups of mixed feed every day, split into three separate meals. We need to find out how much feed she needs to give in the final meal of the day. The flock has 20 chickens.\n\nFirst, let's break down the information. Each chicken gets 3 cups per day, divided into three meals. That means each meal is 1 cup per chicken, right? Because 3 cups divided by 3 meals is 1 cup per meal. Wait, but the problem says she gives them feed in three separate meals. So maybe each meal is 1 cup per chicken. But wait, the problem states that in the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, 25 cups. Hmm, that's more than 1 cup per chicken. Let me think again.\n\nWait, maybe the 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon are the total amounts given in those two meals. Then the final meal is the third one. But each chicken is supposed to get 3 cups total per day. So the total per chicken per day is 3 cups. So for 20 chickens, that's 20 * 3 = 60 cups per day in total.\n\nBut she's already given them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. So the total given so far is 15 + 25 = 40 cups. The remaining feed needed for the final meal would be 60 - 40 = 20 cups. Wait, but that seems straightforward. But maybe there's a trick here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, the problem says she gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. Each meal should be 1 cup per chicken because 3 cups a day divided into three meals. So each meal is 1 cup per chicken. Therefore, for 20 chickens, each meal should be 20 cups. So three meals would be 60 cups total per day. But she's given 15 cups in the morning and 25 in the afternoon. So the third meal should be 60 - (15 +25) = 20 cups. So the answer is 20. But let me make sure I'm not missing anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is that the morning and afternoon meals are not the entire day's feed. Wait, the problem states that she feeds them three times a day, each time with three cups total. Wait, no. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\n\"Every day, Wendi feeds each of her chickens three cups of mixed chicken feed... She gives the chickens their feed in three separate meals. In the morning, she gives her flock 15 cups. In the afternoon, another 25 cups. How many cups does she need to give them in the final meal if the flock is 20 chickens?\"\n\nWait, each chicken gets three cups per day. So total per day for all chickens is 20 * 3 = 60 cups. She's given 15 cups in the morning and 25 in the afternoon. So total given so far is 15 +25 =40 cups. Therefore, the remaining feed needed for the final meal is 60 -40=20 cups. So the answer is 20. That seems straightforward. But maybe there's a mistake here. Let me check again.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is that the morning and afternoon meals are not the entire day's feed. Wait, the problem says she feeds them three separate meals. The morning, afternoon, and final meal. Each meal's quantity should add up to the total per day. But according to the problem, she's given 15 cups in the morning and 25 in the afternoon. So the third meal would need to be 60 - (15+25) =20","ground_truth":"20","predicted_answer":"5","is_correct":false,"from_retry":true,"hint_sentence":"The problem involves understanding the daily feed distribution across meals and relating it to the number of chickens. Consider the total feed given in the morning and afternoon and determine the remaining amount needed to reach the total daily requirement per chicken."}
