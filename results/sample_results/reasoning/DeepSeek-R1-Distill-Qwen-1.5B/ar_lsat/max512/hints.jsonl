Since day 1 features a Greyhound, day 7 must feature either a Manx or a Siamese kitten.\n4. **Himalayan is featured exactly three times, but not on day 1**. Therefore, the remaining three instances of a Hiyanian must be on days 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n5. **Rottweilers are not featured on day 7 or any day with a Hiyanian**.

Since no breed is featured on day 7 with a Hiyanian, the breed on day 7 must be either Manx or Siamese, excluding Hiyanian.\n6. **Himalayan (H) is featured exactly three times, but not on day 1**. Therefore, H must be featured on days 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.\n7. **Rottweilers (R) are not featured on day 7 or any day with a Hiyanian**.

Therefore, Option A is not necessarily true.\n\nOption B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. Let's analyze. If L is selected, we need to consider the constraints.
