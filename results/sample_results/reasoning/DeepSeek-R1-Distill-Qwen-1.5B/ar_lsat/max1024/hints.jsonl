This adds a layer of constraint that affects how you balance the selection of French and non-French works, particularly in the context of how many foreign novels you can select. Remember that you must not exceed four foreign works in total, and you must select at most four French foreign works. Also, the number and types of foreign novels selected must satisfy the given constraints, particularly that French novels are not fewer than Russian novels but not more. This interaction can lead to certain selections being impossible, and your task is to identify which option fits within all these constraints."}
