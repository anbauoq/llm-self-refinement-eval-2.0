The constraints are a bit complex, so I need to break them down carefully.\n\nFirst, we have three people: George, Helen, and Nina. They need to give reports on three days, each on a different day. The conditions are:\n\n1. **Tuesday is George's only day**. So George must give his report on Tuesday.\n2. **Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report**. That means they can only give morning reports.\n3. **If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.**\n\nWait, there's a typo in the third condition. It should probably say \"unless Nina's report is given on Tuesday.\" That makes more sense because if Nina is on Tuesday, the next day, Wednesday, Helen and Irving must give reports. Otherwise, if Nina is on Wednesday, they don't need to give reports on Tuesday because it's already taken by George.\n\nNow, let's outline the possible days each person can be on:\n\n- **George** must be on Tuesday.\n- **Olivia and Robert** can only give morning reports, so they can't be on Tuesday.\n- **Nina** can give a report on any day except Tuesday, but since she can't give an afternoon report, she must give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.\n- **Helen and Irving** can give reports on either morning or afternoon, but they can't both give reports on the same day.\n- **Lindoree** and **Robert** can't give afternoon reports, so they can only give morning reports.\n\nGiven that, let's consider the possibilities for Nina.\n\n**Case 1: Nina is on Monday.**\n\n- If Nina is on Monday, then the next day, Tuesday, Helen and Irving must give reports. But Tuesday is George's day, so this is a conflict because George can't give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina can't be on Monday.\n\n**Case 2: Nina is on Wednesday.**\n\n- If Nina is on Wednesday, then the next day, Tuesday, Helen and Irving must give reports. But Tuesday is George's day, so again, this is a conflict. Therefore, Nina can't be on Wednesday either.\n\nWait, this can't be right. There must be a mistake here. Let me re-examine the conditions.\n\nOh, I see the mistake. The condition says \"if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\" So, if Nina is on Wednesday, the next day (Tuesday) doesn't require Helen and Irving to give reports because Nina's report is on Wednesday. That makes sense.\n\nBut earlier, I thought that would cause a conflict because Tuesday is George's day. So, let's try this again.\n\n**Case 2: Nina is on Wednesday.**\n\n- Nina gives a report on Wednesday.\n- Since Nina's report is on Wednesday, the condition doesn't require Helen and Irving to give reports on Tuesday.\n- Therefore, Helen and Irving can give reports on Tuesday and Monday. But Tuesday is George's day, so they can't be on Tuesday. Therefore, they must be on Monday and... Wait, there are only three days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. If they're on Tuesday and Wednesday, that's fine because Tuesday is George's day, and Wednesday is Nina's day. So, Helen and Irving can give reports on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nWait, but if Nina is on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give reports on Tuesday and... There are only three days, so if they're on Tuesday and Wednesday, that leaves Monday for George. That works.\n\nWait, but earlier, I thought that if Nina is on Wednesday, then the next day (Tuesday) doesn't require Helen and Irving to give reports because Nina's report is on Wednesday. So, they can give reports on Tuesday and Wednesday. But that leaves Helen and Irving to give reports on Tuesday and Wednesday, but Tuesday is George's day. So, they can't be on Tuesday. Therefore, they must be on Monday and... There's only one day left, Tuesday, which is taken by George. So, this is a problem.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let's try assigning Nina to Monday instead.\n\n**Case 1: Nina is on Monday.**\n\n- Nina gives a report on Monday.\n- Since Nina's report is on Monday, the condition doesn't require Helen and Irving to give reports on Tuesday.\n- Therefore, Helen and Irving can give reports on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n- But Tuesday is George's day, so they can't be on Tuesday. Therefore, they must be on Wednesday and...
