Here's the reasoning:\n\n- **Condition 1**: Exactly six students give reports over three days. The morning and afternoon slots each have two reports, so three days × two reports = six reports.\n- **Tuesday**: Only George can report in the mornings, so George must give a morning report on Tuesday. Therefore, the afternoon slot on Tuesday cannot be George.\n- If Nina reports in the afternoons, the next morning report must be Helen or Irving, unless it's on Wednesday. If her report is on a Wednesday, the morning report could be Helen, and the afternoon could be Irving.\n- The options must have two morning reports and two afternoon reports on Tuesday with George in the midday slot. Only **A**, **B**, and **D** satisfy this condition.\n\n**Option C** is incorrect because it places George in a midday afternoon slot, which isn't allowed. **Option D** places Nina in the day after Helen in the same morning slot (Wednesday morning), which violates the condition that if Nina reports, Helen and Ivan must give reports the next evening. **Options B and E** are invalid because they either place Helen and Robert in the correct morning slots or place a report in a conflicting slot, violating the constraints. \n\nThus, **A**: Helen and Bob in the morn on Monday; Robert in afternoon; Tuesday morn: Olivia and afternoon: Irving. **Wednesday morn and afternoon are Lenore and Kyle**.
