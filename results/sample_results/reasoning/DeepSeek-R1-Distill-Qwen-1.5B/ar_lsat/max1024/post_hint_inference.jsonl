I need to figure out the correct schedule of the eight students over three days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) based on the given conditions. There are six reports to be scheduled each day (two reports per day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon). \n\nFirst, I'll list the students: George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert. The key points to remember are:\n\n1. George can only give a report on Tuesday.\n2. Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.\n3. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.\n\nI'll start by noting that George must be on Tuesday. So, George is fixed for Tuesday. This means on Tuesday, we have two reports: one by George and another by either Helen or Irving.\n\nNext, Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so they must give their reports in the morning. This is important because it means on Tuesday and Wednesday, if there's an afternoon report, it must be given by Helen or Irving, but not by Olivia or Robert.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided and see which one fits all the conditions.\n\nOption A:\n- Monday morning: Helen\n- Monday afternoon: Robert\n- Tuesday morning: Olivia\n- Tuesday afternoon: Irving\n- Wednesday morning: Lenore\n- Wednesday afternoon: Kyle\n\nThis option seems to fit all conditions. Let's break it down:\n- George is on Tuesday.\n- Olivia is on Monday morning, which is fine because they can't be afternoon reports.\n- Helen and Robert are on Monday, and since they're in the morning, they're fine.\n- On Tuesday, Helen and Irving both give reports, which is correct because if Nina isn't giving a report on Tuesday, this works.\n- On Wednesday, Lenore and Kyle are in the morning, which is fine.\n- The only condition that could be violated here is if Nina is giving a report, but she isn't, so this option is valid.\n\nOption B:\n- Monday morning: Irving\n- Monday afternoon: Olivia\n- Tuesday morning: Helen\n- Tuesday afternoon: Kyle\n- Wednesday morning: Nina\n- Wednesday afternoon: Lenore\n\nGeorge isn't in this option, but let's check the conditions:\n- If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday unless Nina's report is on Wednesday. However, in this option, only Lenore and Nina are on Wednesday, so this doesn't violate any conditions. The main issue is that Helen is on Tuesday afternoon, which is fine. This option doesn't follow the rule that if Nina gives a report on Wednesday, Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday unless Nina is on Wednesday. Wait, actually, if Nina is on Wednesday, Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. But in this option, only Lenore and Nina are on Wednesday, so this option doesn't follow the rule. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n\nOption C:\n- Monday morning: Lenore\n- Monday afternoon: Helen\n- Tuesday morning: George\n- Tuesday afternoon: Kyle\n- Wednesday morning: Robert\n- Wednesday afternoon: Irving\n\nGeorge is on Tuesday, which is correct. Lenore and Helen are on Monday, which is fine. On Tuesday, George and Kyle give reports, which is correct. On Wednesday, Robert and Irving give reports, which is fine because they can't be afternoon reports. This option also fits all conditions.\n\nOption D:\n- Monday morning: Nina\n- Monday afternoon: Helen\n- Tuesday morning: Robert\n- Tuesday afternoon: Irving\n- Wednesday morning: Olivia\n- Wednesday afternoon: Lenore\n\nGeorge isn't in this option.

But the problem is that if Nina is on Monday, Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. They do, but George is not on Tuesday, which is required. So this option is incorrect because George must give a report on Tuesday.\n\nOption E:\n- Monday morning: Olivia\n- Monday afternoon: Nina\n- Tuesday morning: Irving\n- Tuesday afternoon: Helen\n- Wednesday morning: Kyle\n- Wednesday afternoon: George\n\nGeorge is on Wednesday afternoon, which is fine.
