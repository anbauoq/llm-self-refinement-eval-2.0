The maximum probability that neither will increase is the maximum of these two, which is 0.44. This is because if both events are independent, the least overlap occurs when one event is entirely contained within the other, maximizing the non-overlapping part. Therefore, the greatest probability for neither event is 0.44, which is option B.","full_output":"To determine the greatest probability that neither Stock A nor Stock B will increase in value, we need to consider the maximum overlap of their probabilities. \n\nFirst, the probability that Stock A does not increase is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, and for Stock B, it's 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.

For Stock A, the probability of not increasing is 1 - 0.56 = 0.44, and for Stock B, it's 1 - 0.74 = 0.26. The maximum is 0.44, so the answer is B.","ground_truth":"B","predicted_answer":"B","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}
