{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower. The top of the tower is observed from the car and, in the process, it takes 10 minutes for the angle of elevation to change from 45° to 60°. After how much more time will this car reach the base of the tower?\n# Answer option: ['A)5(√3 + 1)', 'B)6(√3 + √2)', 'C)7(√3 – 1)', 'D)8(√3 – 2)', 'E)None of these']","full_output":"<cot>\n<cot>\nThey are driving towards the tower in a vertical line.

At two different times, the angle from the top to the car changes. The change in angle takes 6 minutes, and we need to know how much longer it will take.\n\nWait, the problem says it takes \"10\" minutes for angle to change.
