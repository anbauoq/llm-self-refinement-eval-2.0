Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, I know that the probability of Stock A increasing is 0.56, and for Stock B it's 0.74. I want to find the probability that neither happens, which means both don't increase.\n\nI remember that for two events, the probability of neither happening is 1 minus the probability that at least one happens. But since we're looking for the maximum probability of neither, I think it's related to the minimum probability of either event. \n\nWait, actually, I think the formula for the probability of neither event A nor event B is P(neither) = 1 - P(A) - P(B) + P(A and B). But to maximize P(neither), I need to consider when P(A and B) is as small as possible.\n\nThe smallest P(A and B) can be is when they are mutually exclusive, meaning they can't both happen at the same time. So, P(A and B) = 0 in that case. So, P(neither) = 1 - P(A) - P(B) + 0 = 1 - 0.56 - 0.74 = 1 - 1.30 = -0.30.\n\nWait, that can't be right because probabilities can't be negative. I must have made a mistake. Maybe I should think differently.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that the probability of neither A nor B is 1 - P(A) - P(B) + P(A and B). To maximize P(neither), I need to minimize P(A and B). The minimum P(A and B) can be is when the events are as exclusive as possible, but in reality, it can't be less than P(A) + P(B) - 1. So, P(A and B) ≥ P(A) + P(B) - 1.\n\nPlugging in the values: P(A and B) ≥ 0.56 + 0.74 - 1 = 0.30.

But that seems counterintuitive because it's possible for both to not increase, but the maximum would be when they both don't increase as much as possible.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the maximum of P(neither) as 1 - max(P(A), P(B)). Since P(A) is 0.56 and P(B) is 0.74, the maximum of these is 0.74. So, P(neither) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.

What is the perimeter of the square?\n\nOptions:\nA)16\nB)24\nC)36\nD)48\nE)64\n\nFirst, find the side length of the square. The area is 16 cm², so side length = sqrt(16) = 4 cm. The perimeter is 4 * 4 = 16 cm. So, the correct answer is A. Alternatively, using the formula for the perimeter of a square, P = 4 * side length. Since the area is 16, side length is 4, so P = 16 cm. \n\n\\boxed{A}\n\nExample 8:\nQuestion: A bag contains 3 red, 4 blue, and 5 green marbles.
