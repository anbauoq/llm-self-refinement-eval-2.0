Using trigonometry, we find that the car travels approximately 27.32 km in 10 minutes. Next, we calculate the time it takes to cover the remaining distance using the speed determined from the initial journey. This results in the car reaching the base of the tower in approximately 6 minutes after the first change in angle. Therefore, the final answer is 6 minutes.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{B}","full_output":"- In this case, write your final answer as a single capital letter: A, B, C, D, or E.\n           - No extra text.\n        - The choices are always labeled A), B), C), D), E).\n        - Inside \\boxed{}, you must output ONLY a single capital letter: A, B, C, D, or E.
