{"id":0,"question":"A car is being driven, in a straight line and at a uniform speed, towards the base of a vertical tower.

Since tan(45°) = 1, the height (h) is equal to the distance from the car to the tower (d) at this point: h = d1 * tan(45°) = d1 * 1 = d1.\n\nWhen the angle of elevation increases to 60°, the new height is h = d2 * tan(60°) = d2 * √3.\n\nSince the height remains the same, we can set d1 = d2 * √3, which gives d1 = d2 * √3.\n\nThe time taken to cover the first distance (d1) at speed v is t1 = d1 / v. The time taken to cover the second distance (d2) at the same speed is t2 = d2 / v.\n\nThe ratio of times is t1 / t2 = (d1 / v) / (d2 / v) = d1 / d2 = √3.\n\nGiven t1 = 10 minutes, t2 = 10 / √3 ≈ 5.774 minutes.\n\nThe car will cover the remaining distance (d2 - d1) at speed v in the remaining time.

To minimize the total number of students who attended at least one event, we assume no overlap, so P + D = 80 + 70 = 150 students. Thus, the number of students who neither attended is 200 − 150 = 50.
