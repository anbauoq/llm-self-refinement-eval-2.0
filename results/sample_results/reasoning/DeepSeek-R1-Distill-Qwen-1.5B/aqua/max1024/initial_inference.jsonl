The customer paid an amount that is $1 more than the original half price, and using a coupon reduced the price by $22. The original item was $6.50, but since the options are in dollars and cents, the closest is $70, option D.

The probability that A increases is 56%, B is  74%. We need the greatest probability that both do not increase. So, the probability neither A nor B increases is the complement of both increasing. So the probability both increase is P(A and B). But since we don't know if the events are independent, we can't directly calculate P(A ∩ B). However, the maximum probability that the neither event occurs would be when the probability of both A and  B increasing is as small as possible. So to maximize the probability where neither occurs, we need to minimize the probability they both increase. But the minimum possible value for P(A∩B) is max(0, P(A) + P(B) -  1).
