I need to find out how much more time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower.\n\nFirst, I'll visualize the situation. There's a vertical tower, and the car is moving towards the base. At some point, the angle of elevation is 45 degrees, and after 10 minutes, it becomes 60 degrees. I need to relate the distances and the time to find the additional time required.\n\nI remember that when dealing with angles of elevation and distances, trigonometry is involved. Specifically, the tangent of the angle of elevation is equal to the height of the tower divided by the horizontal distance from the car to the tower's base. Let me denote the height of the tower as \\( h \\).\n\nAt 45 degrees:\n\\[\n\\tan(45°) = \\frac{h}{d_1}\n\\]\nSince \\(\\tan(45°) = 1\\), this simplifies to \\( h = d_1 \\).\n\nAt 60 degrees:\n\\[\n\\tan(60°) = \\frac{h}{d_2}\n\\]\nWhere \\( d_2 \\) is the new horizontal distance after 10 minutes. Since \\(\\tan(60°) = \\sqrt{3}\\), this gives \\( h = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot d_2 \\).\n\nBut from the first equation, \\( h = d_1 \\), so substituting into the second equation:\n\\[\nd_1 = \\sqrt{3} \\cdot d_2\n\\]\nThis means \\( d_2 = \\frac{d_1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\).\n\nThe distance covered by the car in 10 minutes is \\( d_1 - d_2 \\):\n\\[\nd_1 - d_2 = d_1 - \\frac{d_1}{\\sqrt{3}} = d_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\n\\]\nThe speed of the car \\( v \\) is distance over time:\n\\[\nv = \\frac{d_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}{10 \\text{ minutes}}\n\\]\nNow, to find the time \\( t \\) it takes to cover the remaining distance \\( d_2 \\) at the same speed:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{d_2}{v} = \\frac{\\frac{d_1}{\\sqrt{3}}}{\\frac{d_1 \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}{10}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)}\n\\]\nSimplifying the denominator:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{3} \\left(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right) = \\sqrt{3} - 1\n\\]\nSo,\n\\[\nt = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}\n\\]\nTo rationalize the denominator:\n\\[\nt = \\frac{10 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \\frac{10 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \\frac{10 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 5 (\\sqrt{3} + 1)\n\\]\nTherefore, the additional time required is \\( 5(\\sqrt{3} + 1) \\) minutes, which corresponds to option A.\n</think>\n\nA)5(√3 + 1)\n\nOkay, let me try to figure out this problem. So, we have a car driving towards the base of a vertical tower. The car is moving at a constant speed, and the angle of elevation from the car to the top of the tower changes from 45 degrees to 60 degrees over 10 minutes. I need to find out after how much more time the car will reach the base of the tower.\n\nHmm, angles of elevation and uniform speed. I think I should use some trigonometry here. Let's see, when the angle is 45 degrees, that means the height of the tower is equal to the distance the car has covered so far. Let's call the height of the tower H. So, when the angle is 45 degrees, the distance from the car to the base of the tower is H.\n\nThen, when the angle becomes 60 degrees, the distance from the car to the base has increased. Let's call this new distance D. Using the tangent function, tan(60°) = H / D. I know that tan(60°) is √3, so √3 = H / D, which means D = H / √3.\n\nThe car has moved from H to D in 10 minutes, and we need to find how much longer it will take to go from D to the base. The distance remaining is H - D. Since the car is moving at a constant speed, I can set up a proportion.\n\nLet’s denote the speed as v. In 10 minutes, the car covers D - H distance (because it went from H to D). So, v = (D - H) / 10. But wait, D is H / √3, so D - H = H / √3 - H = H (1/√3 - 1). So, v = H (1/√3 - 1) / 10.\n\nNow, the remaining distance is H - D = H - H / √3 = H (1 - 1/√3). To find the time needed, t = (H (1 - 1/√3)) / v. Substituting v, we get t = (H (1 - 1/√3)) / (H (1/√3 - 1) / 10) = (1 - 1/√3) / (1/√3 - 1) * 10.\n\nSimplifying the fractions, 1 - 1/√3 = (√3 - 1)/√3 and 1/√3 - 1 = (1 - √3)/√3. So, t = ((√3 - 1)/√3) / ((1 - √3)/√3) * 10 = (√3 - 1)/(1 - √3) * 10 = -1 * 10 = -10. Wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake in the signs.\n\nLet me try again. 1 - 1/√3 is positive because 1 is greater than 1/√3. Similarly, 1/√3 - 1 is negative. So, the ratio is negative, but time can't be negative. I think I messed up the direction. Let me correct that.\n\nThe remaining distance is H - D = H (1 - 1/√3). The speed v is (D - H) / 10 = (H / √3 - H) / 10 = H (1/√3 - 1) / 10. So, t = (H (1 - 1/√3)) / (H (1/√3 - 1) / 10) = (1 - 1/√3) / (1/√3 - 1) * 10.\n\nSince (1 - 1/√3) = -(1/√3 - 1), the ratio becomes -1. So, t = (-1) * 10 = -10 minutes. That still doesn't make sense. I must have an error in my setup.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the distances differently. Let's think about it in terms of similar triangles. The angle changes from 45° to 60°, so the distances form similar right triangles. The ratio of the sides should be equal to the ratio of the opposite sides.\n\nFor 45°, opposite side is H, adjacent is H. For 60°, opposite side is H, adjacent is D. So, H / D = tan(60°) = √3, which gives D = H / √3. The distance covered in 10 minutes is D - H = H / √3 - H = H (1/\n\nAlright, let's tackle this problem step by step.

The selling price is given as Rs.360. Hmm, let me think about how profit and cost price relate.\n\nProfit is calculated based on the cost price, right? So if the trader made a 20% profit on the cost price, that means he sold the article for 120% of the cost price. Because 100% is the cost, and 20% is the profit, totaling 120%.\n\nSo, if 120% equals Rs.360, then 100% (the cost price) would be less than that. To find the cost price, I can set up an equation. Let me denote the cost price as C.\n\nSo, 120% of C is Rs.360. In mathematical terms, that's 1.2 * C = 360. To find C, I can divide both sides by 1.2.\n\nC = 360 / 1.2\n\nLet me do the division. 360 divided by 1.2. Hmm, 1.2 times 300 is 360, right? Because 1.2 * 300 = 360. So, C = 300.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If the cost price is Rs.300 and there's a 20% profit, then 20% of 300 is 60. So, the selling price would be 300 + 60 = 360, which matches the given information. So yes, the cost price must be Rs.300.\n\nSo the correct answer is B)300.\n</think>\n\n\\boxed{B}\n\nThe cost price of the article is Rs.300.","ground_truth":"B","predicted_answer":"B","is_correct":true,"was_retried":false}
