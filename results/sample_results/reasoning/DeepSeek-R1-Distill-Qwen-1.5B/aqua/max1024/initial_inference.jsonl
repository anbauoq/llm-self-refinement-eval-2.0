After pulling out 2 marbles each time, the second pull resulted in 1 black marble. The percentage of the second draw matches the percentage in total marbles. Let’s denote the total marbes as Q.\n\nAfter two pulls, 40 marbes were removed (2 each time). The second pull had 1 marble, so 1/40 of the marbes are black. The total marbe percentage is 5/4 (since 1 is ¼ of 4 marbes). Therefore, Q = 96 marbes, but this is not an option. The closest is 98 marbes (option E). However, the correct calculation shows Q = (1/ (1 - 5)) * 9 = 72 marbes? Wait, no. Let me recalculate.\n\nLet’s denote Q as the total. After two pulls of 2 each, 16 marbles are removed. The second draw had 2 pulls, so total marbs removed: 4. The black marbe in the second sample is ½ of the total, so Q = total marb. The first sample had 0 black marb, so all black marbs are in the remaining Q - 4.\n\nThe second draw's black marve is 0 + ½ Q. The proportion is (½ Q) / Q =½. So, the total is 8 marbles? But the options don't have 8. Wait, the options are A)4, B)2, C)3, D)4. No, the question says 2 black marves in the first sample, then 1 in the next. So the total Q is  (1 / (1-5/9)) *9 =9 marbes.\n\nWait, no, the first pull had no black marv, so black marvs are only in the Q -4 marves. The next pull had1 black mar. So 1 = (Q -4)/Q.

So perhaps the correct approach is:\n\nLet’s let Q be the total.\n\nAfter first pull: 0 marb black.\n\nAfter second pull:1 black.\n\nSo, the proportion is ⅓. So Q =3 marbles?\n\nBut the answer options don’t have 3. So maybe the correct total is Q=9 marb.\n\nBut since the options do not include 9 and the correct process leads to 3 marbes in the total? Wait no, because the second marve had ½ the total black marvas. So if the second was 1, then total is2. But the first was 0, but the second is  half. So total is4 marb? No, because 1 /4 =0.25, which would be 2.5 marbes black. But marbes must be whole numbers.\n\nWait the correct equation is:\n\nAfter two marves, 0 and 1.
