{"id":3,"question":"Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?","chain_of_thought":"Josh bought a house for $80,000 and spent an additional $50,000 on repairs, totaling $130,000. The repairs increased the house's value by 150%, which is 1.5 times the original price. So, the increased value is 130,000 × 1.5 = $195,000. The total value of the house after repairs is $130,000 + $195,000 = $325,000.
