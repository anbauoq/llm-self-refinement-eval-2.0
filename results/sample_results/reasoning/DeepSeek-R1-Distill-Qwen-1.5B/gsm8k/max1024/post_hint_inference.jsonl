{"id":2,"question":"A robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber and half that much white fiber.  How many bolts in total does it take?","full_output":"Example 1: <cot_ans>7</cot_ans>\n           Example <cot_answer>75</cot_answer>\n</cot_start>\n```<cot_start>\n\nA robe requires 2 full bolts of **blue** fiber. The problem states that the robe also takes half as much **white** fiber as it does blue fiber. \n\nFirst, we need to determine the amount of white fiber required. Since the white fiber is half the amount needed for blue fiber, we calculate:\n\nWhite fiber = ½ × Blue fiber\nWhite fiber= ½×2 =1\n\nTherefore, the robe takes **2 bolts** of blue and **1 bolt** of white.\n\nTo find the **total number of bolts**, we add both quantities:\n\nTotal bolts = Blue fiber + White fiber\nTotal bolts=2 +1=3\n\nSo, the total number of **bolts** required is **3**.\n\n</cot_end>\n```","chain_of_thought":"Example 1: <cot_ans>7</cot_ans>\n           Example <cot_answer>75</cot_answer>\n</cot_start>\n```<cot_start>\n\nA robe requires 2 full bolts of **blue** fiber.
