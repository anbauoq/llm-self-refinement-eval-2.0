{"id":3,"question":"Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?","chain_of_thought":"Josh bought a house for $80,000 and invested $50,000 in repairs. The 150% increase applies to the repair cost, not the total investment. So, the repair cost after the increase is $50,000 + 150% of $50,000 = $50,000 + $75,000 = $125,000. The total investment is the original house price plus the repaired value: $80,000 + $125,000 = $205,000. Josh's profit is the total investment minus the original price: $205,000 - $80,000 = $125,000.","full_output":"Josh bought a house for $80,000 and invested $50,000 in repairs.

This results in an additional $75,000, making the total value $125,000. Adding this to the original $80,000 purchase price, the total investment is $205,000. Subtracting the original price from the total investment gives Josh a profit of $125,000.\n\n\\boxed{125000}","ground_truth":"70000","predicted_answer":"125000","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false}
