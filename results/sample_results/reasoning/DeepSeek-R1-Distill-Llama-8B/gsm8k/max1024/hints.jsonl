{"id":3,"question":"Josh decides to try flipping a house.  He buys a house for $80,000 and then puts in $50,000 in repairs.  This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?","chain_of_thought":"Josh bought a house for $80,000 and invested $50,000 in repairs, bringing the total investment to $130,000. The value increased by 150%, so the new value is $130,000 * 1.5 = $195,000. His profit is the new value minus the original purchase price: $195,000 - $80,000 = $115,000.","full_output":"Josh bought a house for $80,000 and invested $50,000 in repairs, bringing the total investment to $130,000.

After a 150% increase, the value becomes $130,000 * 1.5 = $195,000. Profit is $195,000 - $80,000 = $115,000.\n\n\\boxed{115000}","ground_truth":"70000","predicted_answer":"115000","is_correct":false,"was_retried":false,"hint_sentence":"The 150% increase applies to the repair cost, not the total investment. This means you should calculate the increase separately before determining the profit."}
