You answered this question incorrectly.

Question: {question}
Your reasoning: {chain_of_thought}
Your answer: {predicted_answer}
Correct answer: {correct_answer}

Your task:

1. Figure out WHY your previous reasoning led to the wrong answer.
2. Write a HINT that contains only the extra facts, clarifications, or reasoning patterns that would have helped you select the correct choice if they had been included in the original question.

IMPORTANT FORMAT RULES FOR THE HINT:
- Do NOT say whether anything is correct or incorrect.
- Do NOT use the words: "plausible", "implausible", "likely", "unlikely".
- Do NOT write "Yes", "No", "True", "False", "correct", "incorrect", or "answer".
- Do NOT mention "the correct answer", "your previous answer", or phrases like "you should choose..." or "you should answer...".
- Do NOT name or quote a specific option as being right or wrong (e.g., do NOT say "Option C is..." or "the third choice is...").
- Do NOT directly compute or state the final result if the question involves numbers.
- The hint must read like neutral background information or guidance, not a verdict.

Focus on:
- Clarifying exactly what the question is asking for and which information in the problem is relevant.
- Explaining the key logical steps, comparisons, or computations needed to distinguish between the options.
- Highlighting constraints, definitions, or subtle wording that rule out certain types of choices (for example, impossible values, wrong units, or contradictions with the given conditions).

Return ONLY 1–3 sentences of hint text, wrapped inside a single <hint>...</hint> block, with no bullet points and no extra commentary.
