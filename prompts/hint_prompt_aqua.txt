Your job is to look at the model’s reasoning, the model’s chosen answer, and the correct answer, then write a short HINT that would have helped the model arrive at the correct option if that hint had been included in the original question.

IMPORTANT RULES FOR THE HINT:
- Do NOT write the correct answer or the correct option letter in the hint sentences.
- Do NOT directly compute or state the final numerical result.
- Do NOT mention any option letters (A–E) or say any option is wrong/right.
- The hint must read like neutral background information or guidance.

Here are a few examples of hints that follow the requirements:

Example 1:
Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400.

Options:
A)226
B)230
C)240
D)260
E)280

Your reasoning: They make 420 units per month for 12 months, so in a year they sell 420 * 12 = 5040 components. Production cost per unit is 110, so total yearly cost is 5040 * 110 = 554400. Let p be the selling price per component. Yearly revenue is 5040p, so profit is 5040p - 554400. We need 5040p - 554400 >= 626400, so 5040p >= 1180800 and p >= 1180800 / 5040 = 234.3. The closest answer choice to that number is 230, so the correct answer is B.

Your answer: B
Correct answer: C
<hint>The selling price can not be smaller than the exact value that makes yearly profit equal to $626,400, because anything smaller would not guarantee meeting that target.</hint>

Example 2:
Question: In how many ways can the letters of the word \"PROBLEC\" be rearranged to make 7 letter words such that none of the letters repeat?

Options:
A)2!
B)3!
C)7!
D)8!
E)9!

Your reasoning: “PROBLEC” has 7 distinct letters. At each position you can either place one of the 7 unused letters or place none, so you start with 8 choices for the first position, then 7, then 6, and so on, giving 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 8!.
Your answer: D
Correct answer: C
<hint>There is no “none” or “empty” choice in a 7 letter word, so each of the 7 positions must be filled by one of the 7 letters exactly once.</hint>

Example 3:
Question: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?

Options:
A)(zy – 2x)/z
B)(zy – 2)/z
C)(zx – y)/(z – 2)
D)(zy – 2x)/(z -2)
E)(zy – x)/(z + 2)

Your reasoning: The average score when all scores are taken into account is y = zy / z, where zy is the sum of all scores. To exclude the highest and lowest scores from the results, we need to subtract from the sum of all scores the highest and lowest scores, whose sum is 2x. Hence, the correct answer is (zy - 2x)/z, which matches option A.
Your answer: A
Correct answer: D
<hint>When you remove the highest and lowest scores, you also remove two students from the total count, so the new average must be computed by dividing by z minus 2.</hint>

Example 4:
Question: A phone has a marked price of $200. It is sold with a 10% discount on the marked price and then a 5% sales tax is applied on the discounted price. What is the final price the customer pays?

Options:
A)180
B)185
C)189
D)190
E)195

Your reasoning: The marked price is 200. A 10% discount is 20, so the discounted price is 200 - 20 = 180. Then a 5% sales tax is 5% of the original 200, which is 10, so add 10 to 180 to get 190. Therefore the final price is 190, which is option D.
Your answer: D
Correct answer: E
<hint>When computing the 5% tax, apply it to the discounted price after the 10% discount, not to the original 200.</hint>
