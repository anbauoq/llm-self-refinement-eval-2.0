You answered this multiple-choice math question incorrectly.

Your job is to analyze your earlier reasoning and then write a short HINT that would have helped you solve the problem correctly, if it had been included in the original question.

IMPORTANT FORMAT RULES FOR THE HINT:
- Do NOT say whether anything is correct or incorrect.
- Do NOT write the correct answer or the correct option letter in the hint sentences.
- Do NOT mention "the correct answer", "your previous answer", or phrases like "you should choose ...".
- Do NOT directly compute or state the final numerical result.
- The hint must read like neutral background information or guidance, not a verdict.

Focus on:
- Clarifying what each quantity in the problem represents and how they relate.
- Highlighting the correct algebraic setup and order of operations needed (which numbers to add, subtract, multiply, or divide first).
- Pointing out important constraints, unit conversions, or intermediate steps that were overlooked or misapplied.

Return ONLY 1–3 sentences of hint text, wrapped inside a single <hint>...</hint> block, with no bullet points and no extra commentary.

Here are some examples of good hints:

Example 1:
Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400?
# Answer option: ['A)226', 'B)230', 'C)240', 'D)260', 'E)280']
Your reasoning: They make 420 each month, so in a year that’s 420×12 units. I set yearly profit as (420×12×selling price) minus 110, and that gave a price around 228, so I picked the closest option 226.
Your answer: A
Correct answer: C
<hint> Profit per unit is selling price minus 110, and yearly profit is (selling price − 110) × 420 × 12. After you compute the minimum price, choose an option that is at least that value, not just the closest one.</hint>

Example 2:
Question: In how many ways can the letters of the word "PROBLEC" be rearranged to make 7-letter words such that none of the letters repeat?
# Answer option: ['A)2!', 'B)3!', 'C)7!', 'D)8!', 'E)9!']
Your reasoning: 
Your answer: D
Correct answer: C
<hint> Count how many distinct letters actually appear in the word and use the factorial of that number to count permutations, making sure you do not introduce extra positions that are not there in the original word.</hint>

Example 3:
Question: An exam is given in a certain class. The average (arithmetic mean) of the highest score and the lowest score is equal to x. If the average score for the entire class is equal to y and there are z students in the class, where z > 5, then in terms of x, y, and z, what is the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers?
# Answer option: ['A)(zy – 2x)/z', 'B)(zy – 2)/z', 'C)(zx – y)/(z – 2)', 'D)(zy – 2x)/(z -2)', 'E)(zy – x)/(z + 2)']
Your reasoning: I subtracted x instead of subtracting the total of the highest and lowest scores, and I forgot to change the number of students in the denominator after removing two scores.
Your answer: A
Correct answer: D
<hint> Express the total sum of all scores as z times the overall average, then subtract the combined highest and lowest scores using their average x to get the remaining sum, and finally divide by z minus 2 to account for the removal of two students.</hint>

Example 4:
Question: A wire in the shape of a rectangle of length 27 cm and breadth 17 cm is rebent to form a square. What will be the measure of each side?
# Answer option: ['A)9', 'B)11', 'C)31', 'D)25', 'E)22']
Your reasoning: I added the length and breadth once to get 44 cm and used that as the side of the new square.
Your answer: C
Correct answer: E
<hint> First compute the perimeter of the original rectangle by adding length and breadth and multiplying by 2, then use that same total length as the perimeter of the square and divide by 4 to obtain the side length.</hint>
