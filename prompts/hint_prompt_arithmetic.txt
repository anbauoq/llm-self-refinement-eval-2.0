You answered this question incorrectly.

Your job is to analyze your earlier reasoning and then write a short HINT that would have helped you solve the problem correctly, if it had been included in the original question.

IMPORTANT FORMAT RULES FOR THE HINT:
- Do NOT say whether anything is correct or incorrect.
- Do NOT write the correct answer in the hint sentences.
- Do NOT mention "the correct answer", "your previous answer", or phrases like "you should answer ...".
- Do NOT directly compute or state the final numerical result.
- The hint must read like neutral background information or guidance, not a verdict.

Focus on:
- Clarifying what each quantity in the problem represents and how they relate.
- Highlighting the correct operations and order of operations needed (e.g., which numbers to add, subtract, multiply, or divide first).
- Pointing out important constraints, unit conversions, or intermediate steps that were overlooked or misapplied.

Here are some examples of good hints:

Example 1:
Question: Sarah has 15 apples. She buys 9 more apples and then gives 7 apples to her friend. How many apples does Sarah have now?
Your reasoning: I added 15 and 9 to get 24, then I accidentally added 7 instead of subtracting it, so I got 31 apples.
Your answer: 31
Correct answer: 17
<hint>When something is given away, that quantity should be subtracted from the total, not added. Make sure to first combine the apples she starts with and buys, then remove the ones she gives to her friend.</hint>

Example 2:
Question: A store sells pencils in boxes of 8. If a teacher needs 50 pencils for her class, how many full boxes should she buy?
Your reasoning: I divided 50 by 8 and got 6.25, so I used 6 boxes as my final result.
Your answer: 6
Correct answer: 7
<hint>After dividing the total number of items by the box size, if there is any remainder, you need to round up to the next whole box so that the total number of items is enough.</hint>

Example 3:
Question: A tank can hold 120 liters of water. It is currently 35% full. How many more liters of water are needed to fill the tank completely?
Your reasoning: I multiplied 120 by 0.35 to get 42 and used 42 as the final answer.
Your answer: 42
Correct answer: 78
<hint>First find how many liters are already in the tank using the given percentage, then subtract that amount from the total capacity to get how many liters are still needed.</hint>

Example 4:
Question: A bakery packs 6 cookies in each box. In the morning it sells 14 boxes, and in the afternoon it sells 9 boxes. How many cookies does the bakery sell in total that day?
Your reasoning: I multiplied 6 by 14 to get 84 and then added 9, so I got 93 cookies.
Your answer: 93
Correct answer: 138
<hint>You should first combine the total number of boxes sold in the morning and afternoon, then multiply that total number of boxes by the number of cookies in each box.</hint>
