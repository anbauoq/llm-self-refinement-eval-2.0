Your job is to look at the model’s reasoning, the model’s calculated answer, and the correct answer, then write a short HINT that would have helped the model arrive at the correct answer if that hint had been included in the original question.

IMPORTANT FORMAT RULES FOR THE HINT:
- Do NOT say whether anything is correct or incorrect.
- Do NOT write the correct answer in the hint sentences.
- Do NOT mention "the correct answer", "your previous answer", or phrases like "you should answer ...".
- Do NOT directly compute or state the final numerical result.
- The hint must read like neutral background information or guidance, not a verdict.

Focus on:
- Clarifying what each quantity in the problem represents and how they relate.
- Highlighting the correct operations and order of operations needed (e.g., which numbers to add, subtract, multiply, or divide first).
- Pointing out important constraints, unit conversions, or intermediate steps that were overlooked or misapplied.

Here are some examples of good hints:

Example 1:
Question: Sarah has 15 apples. She buys 9 more apples and then gives 7 apples to her friend. How many apples does Sarah have now?
Your reasoning: Sarah buys 9 apples and then gives 7 of them to her friend, hence she is left with 9 - 7 = 2 apples.
Your answer: 2
Correct answer: 17
<hint>Do not forget to add the apples Sarah already had before accounting for the apples she buys and gives away.</hint>

Example 2:
Question: A store sells pencils in boxes of 8. If a teacher needs 50 pencils for her class, how many full boxes should she buy?
Your reasoning: If 50 pencils are needed, then 50 divided by 8 equals 6.25 boxes. Since the store only sells full boxes, we round to the nearest whole number of boxes. Because 6.25 is closer to 6 than to 7, the teacher should buy 6 full boxes.
Your answer: 6
Correct answer: 7
<hint>After dividing the total number of items by the box size, if there is any remainder, you need to round up to the next whole box so that the total number of items is enough.</hint>

Example 3:
Question: A tank can hold 120 liters of water. It is currently 35% full. How many more liters of water are needed to fill the tank completely?
Your reasoning: Since 35 liters out of 120 are already filled, to feel the tank completely we need to add 120 - 35 = 85 liters.
Your answer: 85
Correct answer: 78
<hint>You need to convert the percentage into the actual number of liters currently in the tank by taking that fraction of the total capacity.</hint>

Example 4:
Question: A bakery packs 6 cookies in each box. In the morning it sells 14 boxes, and in the afternoon it sells 9 boxes. How many cookies does the bakery sell in total that day?
Your reasoning: The bakery sells 14 boxes in the morning and 9 boxes in the afternoon, so that’s 14 + 9 = 23 boxes total. Since each box has 6 cookies, a quick estimate is to multiply 6 by 20 to get 120 cookies, and then adjust a little for the extra 3 boxes by adding 3 more cookies, giving 123 cookies total.
Your answer: 123
Correct answer: 138
<hint>It’s important to keep in mind that each box has 6 cookies, so always multiply the number of boxes by 6 to get the total amount of cookies.</hint>

Now, based on the question, your reasoning, your answer, and the correct answer, write a new hint.

Return ONLY 1–3 sentences of hint text, wrapped inside a single <hint>...</hint> block, with no extra commentary and without leaking correct answer.

Question: {question}
Your reasoning: {chain_of_thought}
Your answer: {predicted_answer}
Correct answer: {correct_answer}
