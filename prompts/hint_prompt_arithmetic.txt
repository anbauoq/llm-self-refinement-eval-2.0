You answered this question incorrectly.

Question: {question}
Your reasoning: {chain_of_thought}
Your answer: {predicted_answer}
Correct answer: {correct_answer}

Your task:

1. Figure out WHY your previous reasoning led to the wrong answer.
2. Write a HINT that contains only the extra facts or reasoning patterns that would have helped you answer correctly if they had been included in the original question.

IMPORTANT FORMAT RULES FOR THE HINT:
- Do NOT say whether anything is correct or incorrect.
- Do NOT use the words: "plausible", "implausible", "likely", "unlikely".
- Do NOT write "Yes", "No", "True", "False", "correct", "incorrect", or "answer".
- Do NOT mention "the correct answer", "your previous answer", or phrases like "you should answer ...".
- Do NOT directly compute or state the final numerical result.
- The hint must read like neutral background information or guidance, not a verdict.

Focus on:
- Clarifying what each quantity in the problem represents and how they relate.
- Highlighting the correct operations and order of operations needed (e.g., which numbers to add, subtract, multiply, or divide first).
- Pointing out important constraints, unit conversions, or intermediate steps that were overlooked or misapplied.

Return ONLY 1–3 sentences of hint text, wrapped inside a single <hint>...</hint> block, with no bullet points and no extra commentary.
