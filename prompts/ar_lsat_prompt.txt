Answer a multiple-choice question by showing your full reasoning between <think> and </think>. 
Then on a new line, write your final answer choice between <ans> </ans>.

Important:
Your output MUST have this structure, in this order:
  1) A reasoning section between <think> and </think>.
  2) The final answer inside <ans> </ans>.
Note: the choices are always labeled A, B, C, D, E. You must output only one letter as final answer. No extra text.

Example 1:
Question: Five speakers—Alex, Blair, Casey, Devin, and Erin—will each give one talk at a one-day conference. The conference has five consecutive time slots, numbered 1 through 5, from earliest to latest. The following conditions apply:
1. Alex speaks earlier than Blair.
2. Casey speaks immediately before Devin.
3. Erin does not speak in the first time slot.
Which one of the following could be the order of the speakers from the first to the fifth time slot?
A) Slot 1: Alex;  Slot 2: Blair;  Slot 3: Devin; Slot 4: Casey; Slot 5: Erin
B) Slot 1: Erin;  Slot 2: Alex;  Slot 3: Casey; Slot 4: Devin; Slot 5: Blair
C) Slot 1: Casey; Slot 2: Devin; Slot 3: Alex;  Slot 4: Blair; Slot 5: Erin
D) Slot 1: Casey; Slot 2: Alex;  Slot 3: Devin; Slot 4: Blair; Slot 5: Erin
E) Slot 1: Blair; Slot 2: Alex;  Slot 3: Casey; Slot 4: Devin; Slot 5: Erin
<think>
Casey must be immediately before Devin, so look for the block “C, D”: only C) and E) have C and D adjacent in that order. In E), B is in slot 1 and A in slot 2, so Blair speaks earlier than Alex, violating the rule that Alex must speak earlier than Blair. In C), C is in slot 1 and D in slot 2 (immediately before), A is in slot 3 and B in slot 4 (Alex earlier than Blair), and E is in slot 5 (not in the first slot), so all three conditions are satisfied. Therefore C is the only possible schedule.

Example 2:
Question: Four workshops—Data, Ethics, Finance, and Law—are scheduled, one per day, on four consecutive days from Monday through Thursday. Each workshop is held exactly once. The following conditions apply:
1. Data is held earlier in the week than Finance.
2. Ethics is not held on Monday.
3. Law is not held on Thursday.
Which one of the following could be the schedule of workshops from Monday through Thursday?
A) Mon: Data;  Tue: Ethics; Wed: Law;   Thu: Finance
B) Mon: Ethics; Tue: Finance; Wed: Data;  Thu: Law
C) Mon: Data;  Tue: Ethics;    Wed: Finance; Thu: Law
D) Mon: Finance; Tue: Data; Wed: Ethics;  Thu: Law
E) Mon: Law;    Tue: Finance; Wed: Ethics; Thu: Data
<think>
Data must be earlier than Finance, Ethics cannot be Monday, and Law cannot be Thursday. In A, Data is Monday, Ethics Tuesday, Law Wednesday, Finance Thursday, so all three rules are satisfied. B fails because Ethics is on Monday, C and D fail because Law is on Thursday, and D and E also fail because Data is not earlier than Finance. Therefore only A could be the schedule.

<ans>A</ans>

Example 3:
Question: A committee of exactly three people is to be formed from four candidates: Rosa, Sam, Tariq, and Uma. The following conditions apply:
1. Sam must be on the committee.
2. If Rosa is on the committee, Tariq is not on the committee.
3. Uma cannot be on the committee unless Rosa is also on the committee.
Which of the following could be the complete set of committee members?
A) Rosa, Sam, Tariq
B) Sam, Tariq, Uma
C) Rosa, Sam, Uma
D) Sam only
E) Rosa, Tariq, Uma
<think>
Sam must be on the 3-person committee. Uma can only serve if Rosa is also serving, and Rosa and Tariq cannot both be on the committee. Testing the options, A has Rosa and Tariq together (invalid), B has Uma without Rosa (invalid), D has only Sam (not 3 people), and E omits Sam and also has Rosa with Tariq (invalid). Only C includes Sam, pairs Uma with Rosa as required, and avoids putting Tariq with Rosa, so it satisfies all constraints.

Example 4:
Question: Three houses—A, B, and C—are each painted a different color, chosen from exactly red, green, and blue. No two houses share the same color. The following conditions apply:
1. House A is not painted red.
2. House B is not painted blue.
3. House C is painted either green or blue.
Which one of the following could be the assignment of colors to the houses A, B, and C?
A) A: red;    B: green; C: blue
B) A: red;    B: blue;  C: green
C) A: green;  B: red;   C: blue
D) A: blue;   B: blue;  C: red
E) A: green;  B: blue;  C: red
<think>
Test each option against the rules: A is invalid because A is red, B is invalid because A is red, D is invalid because A and B are both blue so the colors are not all different, and E is invalid because C is red instead of green or blue; C has A = green (not red), B = red (not blue), and C = blue (green/blue allowed) with all three colors distinct, so it is the only option that satisfies every condition.

Example 5:
Question: Three packages—J, K, and L—are each shipped on a different day, on three consecutive days from Monday through Wednesday. The following conditions apply:
1. K is shipped earlier than J.
2. L is not shipped on Monday.
Which one of the following must be true?
A) J is shipped on Monday.
B) J is shipped on Wednesday.
C) K is shipped on Monday.
D) L is shipped on Tuesday.
E) L is shipped on Wednesday.

<think>
There are three days: Mon, Tue, Wed. L cannot be Monday. Case 1: L is Tuesday. Then K and J must use Monday and Wednesday with K earlier than J, so K Monday, J Wednesday. Case 2: L is Wednesday. Then K and J must use Monday and Tuesday with K earlier than J, so K Monday, J Tuesday. In all valid schedules K is always on Monday, while J and L can vary, so the only statement that must always be true is that K is shipped on Monday which is option C.

Example 6:
Question: Four books—G, H, J, and K—are to be arranged in a row on a shelf from left to right. Each position holds exactly one book. The following conditions apply:
1. H is somewhere to the left of J.
2. K is immediately to the right of H.
3. G is not at either end of the row.
Which one of the following could be the order of the books from left to right?
A) G, H, K, J
B) H, K, G, J
C) H, G, K, J
D) J, H, K, G
E) G, H, J, K
<think>
Because K must be immediately to the right of H, they must appear as the pair H, K in consecutive positions, and since H is to the left of J, J must be somewhere to the right of that pair. G cannot be at either end, so G must be in one of the middle positions. In A and E, G is at the left end, so both are invalid. In C, G is between H and K, so K is not immediately to the right of H. In D, J is to the left of H, violating the rule that H is to the left of J. Only B has H, K as a consecutive pair, J to the right of H, and G in an internal position, so B is the valid order.
