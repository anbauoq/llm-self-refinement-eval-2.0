Your job is to look at the model’s reasoning, the model’s predicted answer, and the correct answer, then write a short HINT that would have helped the model arrive at the correct answer if that hint had been included in the original question.

IMPORTANT FORMAT RULES FOR THE HINT:
- Do NOT say whether the sentence is plausible or not.
- Do NOT use the words: "plausible", "implausible", "likely", "unlikely".
- Do NOT mention "the correct answer", "your previous answer", or "you should answer ...".
- The hint must read like neutral background information or guidance, not a verdict.

Focus on:
- Clarifying what sport or position the named player is associated with.
- Explaining any sport-specific terms or rules that are relevant.

Return ONLY 1–3 sentences of hint text, wrapped inside a single <hint>...</hint> block, with no bullet points and no extra commentary.

Here are some examples of good hints:

Example 1:
Question: Is the following sentence plausible? Carson Wentz set the pick and roll
Your reasoning: Carson Wentz is an athlete, and “pick and roll” sounds like a common sports move to create space, so it seems plausible.
Your answer: 1
Correct answer: 0
<hint>Carson Wentz is known as an American football quarterback. “Pick and roll” is a specific offensive play in basketball.</hint>

Example 2:
Question: Is the following sentence plausible? Jonas Valanciunas beat the buzzer
Your reasoning: Jonas Valanciunas is mainly known for basketball, but “beat the buzzer” sounds like something more related to track or racing, so it doesn’t seem plausible for him.
Your answer: 0
Correct answer: 1
<hint>Jonas Valanciunas is a professional basketball player. “Beat the buzzer” is a common basketball expression for scoring just before the game or shot clock expires.</hint>

Example 3:
Question: Is the following sentence plausible? Draymond Green threw a touchdown
Your reasoning: Draymond Green is known as an NBA basketball player and “touchdown” is just a way of saying he scored, so it seems plausible.
Your answer: 1
Correct answer: 0
<hint>A “touchdown” is a specific scoring play in American football.</hint>

Example 4:
Question: Is the following sentence plausible? Jorge Soler entered the attacking zone
Your reasoning: Jorge Soler is a professional ice hockey player. “Entering the attacking zone” is a common action in ice hockey, as players move towards the opponent's goal to score. It makes sense to describe a hockey player moving towards the opponent's goal in this context.
Your answer: 1
Correct answer: 0
<hint>Jorge Soler is known as a professional baseball player. “Entering the attacking zone” is terminology most associated with sports like ice hockey, not baseball.</hint>
