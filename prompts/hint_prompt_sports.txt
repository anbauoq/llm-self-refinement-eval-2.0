You answered this question incorrectly.

Question: {question}
Your reasoning: {chain_of_thought}
Your answer: {predicted_answer}
Correct answer: {correct_answer}

Your task:

1. Figure out WHY your previous reasoning led to the wrong answer.
2. Write a HINT that contains only the extra facts or reasoning patterns that would have helped you answer correctly if it had been included in the original question.

IMPORTANT FORMAT RULES FOR THE HINT:
- Do NOT say whether the sentence is plausible or not.
- Do NOT use the words: "plausible", "implausible", "likely", "unlikely".
- Do NOT write "Yes", "No", "True", "False", "correct", "incorrect", or "answer".
- Do NOT mention "the correct answer", "your previous answer", or "you should answer ...".
- The hint must read like neutral background information or guidance, not a verdict.

Focus on:
- Clarifying what sport or position the named player is associated with.
- Explaining any sport-specific terms or rules that are relevant.
- Correcting any misunderstanding from your earlier reasoning.
- Highlighting when the sentence is mixing terminology from different sports.

Return ONLY 1–3 sentences of hint text, wrapped inside a single <hint>...</hint> block, with no bullet points and no extra commentary.

Here are some examples of good hints:

Example 1:
Question: Is the following sentence plausible? Carson Wentz set the pick and roll
Your reasoning: I thought any professional athlete could reasonably be described using plays from different sports, so I treated this as a normal kind of offensive action.
Your answer: 1
Correct answer: 0
<hint>Carson Wentz is known as an American football quarterback, while a “pick and roll” is a specific offensive play in basketball, so pay attention to whether the action being described belongs to the same sport as the player.</hint>

Example 2:
Question: Is the following sentence plausible? Jonas Valanciunas beat the buzzer
Your reasoning: I focused on the phrase “beat the buzzer” as something that might be used in many sports and didn’t think about which sport Jonas Valanciunas actually plays.
Your answer: 0
Correct answer: 1
<hint>Jonas Valanciunas is a professional basketball player, and “beat the buzzer” is a common basketball expression for scoring just before the game or shot clock expires, so consider whether the phrase is standard within that sport.</hint>

Example 3:
Question: Is the following sentence plausible? Draymond Green threw a touchdown
Your reasoning: I only noticed that Draymond Green is an athlete and that touchdowns are part of sports, so I treated the combination as reasonable.
Your answer: 1
Correct answer: 0
<hint>Draymond Green is a professional basketball player in the NBA, whereas a “touchdown” is a scoring play in American football, so think about whether the scoring action described actually occurs in the player’s sport.</hint>

Example 4:
Question: Is the following sentence plausible? Liam Hendricks hit a double in the World Series
Your reasoning: I assumed pitchers almost never hit in important games and focused on his position rather than on the rules of baseball.
Your answer: 0
Correct answer: 1
<hint>Liam Hendriks is a Major League Baseball pitcher, and in some games pitchers do bat, so consider that a “double” is a standard batting result and that pitchers can sometimes achieve this in the World Series.</hint>

Now, based on the question, your reasoning, your answer, and the correct answer given at the top, write a new hint.

Return ONLY 1–3 sentences of hint text, wrapped inside a single <hint>...</hint> block, with no bullet points and no extra commentary.
