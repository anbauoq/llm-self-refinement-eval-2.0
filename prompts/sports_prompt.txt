Your goal is to answer given plausibility question by showing step-by-step reasoning between <think> and </think> and writing final answer choice between <ans> </ans>.

You MUST output exactly two blocks, in this order, with no extra text before, between, or after them:
<think>concise step-by-step reasoning</think>
<ans>X</ans>

Decision rule for X:
- X must be exactly one digit: 1 or 0.
- Output 1 if the sentence is reasonably true in a real-world sports setting.
- Output 0 if it’s unlikely or inconsistent in a real-world sports setting.

Rules:
- Do NOT repeat the question or any example text.
- Do NOT output anything else after stating the final answer.

The following are examples of correctly formatted outputs, you must NOT echo those examples or continue providing your own examples.

Example 1:
Question: Is the following sentence plausible? Kyle Palmieri was called for slashing
<think>Kyle Palmieri is a professional ice hockey player. “Slashing” is a common penalty in ice hockey. It is normal and plausible for a hockey player to be called for slashing. So this sentence is plausible.</think>
<ans>1</ans>

Example 2:
Question: Is the following sentence plausible? Joao Moutinho caught the screen pass in the NFC championship
<think>Joao Moutinho is a professional soccer player. A “screen pass” and the “NFC championship” are terms from American football, not soccer.It is very unlikely and contextually wrong to describe this soccer player in an NFL playoff game catching a screen pass. So this sentence is not plausible.</think>
<ans>0</ans>

Example 3:
Question: Is the following sentence plausible? Carson Wentz set the pick and roll
<think>Carson Wentz is a professional American football quarterback. A “pick and roll” is a common play in basketball, not in football.
Describing a football quarterback as running a pick and roll is mixing sports terms in an unnatural way. So this sentence is not plausible.</think>
<ans>0</ans>

Example 4:
Question: Is the following sentence plausible? Jonas Valanciunas beat the buzzer
<think>Jonas Valanciunas is a professional basketball player. “Beat the buzzer” is a normal basketball phrase meaning he scored just before the game or shot clock expired. This is a common thing that can happen in basketball games. So this sentence is plausible.</think>
<ans>1</ans>

Example 5:
Question: Is the following sentence plausible? Jamel Murray was perfect from the line
<think>This refers to Jamal Murray, a professional basketball player. “Perfect from the line” means making all free throws, which is a standard basketball expression. It is normal and realistic for a good shooter to be perfect from the free throw line in a game. So this sentence is plausible.</think>
<ans>1</ans>

Example 6:
Question: Is the following sentence plausible? Sam Darnold passed the puck
<think>Sam Darnold is a professional American football quarterback. “Passed the puck” is an ice hockey phrase, because the puck is used in hockey, not football. Using a hockey-specific action for a known football quarterback is mixing sports in an unnatural way. So this sentence is not plausible.</think>
<ans>0</ans>
