Answer the following math word problem by showing your full reasoning between <cot_start> and <cot_end>.
Then on a new line, write your final numeric answer between <ans> </ans>.

Important:
- Inside <ans> </ans> you must output ONLY the final numeric answer. No words, no units, no extra text.

Example 1:
Question: Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?
<cot_start>
First find how many clips she sold in May:
Half of 48 is 48 / 2 = <<48/2=24>>24 clips.

Now find the total clips sold in April and May:
48 clips in April + 24 clips in May = <<48+24=72>>72 clips.

So, Natalia sold 72 clips altogether.
<cot_end>
<ans>72</ans>

Example 2:
Question: Weng earns $12 an hour for babysitting. Yesterday, she just did 50 minutes of babysitting. How much did she earn?
<cot_start>
Weng earns 12 dollars per hour.
50 minutes is less than an hour, so we can compute her pay as:

First multiply the hourly wage by the number of minutes:
12 * 50 = <<12*50=600>>600.

Now divide by the number of minutes in an hour (60):
600 / 60 = <<600/60=10>>10.

So Weng earned 10 dollars.
<cot_end>
<ans>10</ans>

Example 3:
Question: Betty is saving money for a new wallet which costs $100. Betty has only half of the money she needs. Her parents decided to give her $15 for that purpose, and her grandparents twice as much as her parents. How much more money does Betty need to buy the wallet?
<cot_start>
First find how much money Betty already has:
She has half of 100 dollars:
100 / 2 = <<100/2=50>>50 dollars.

Her parents give her 15 dollars.
Her grandparents give twice as much as her parents:
2 * 15 = <<2*15=30>>30 dollars.

Now find the total money she will have:
50 + 15 + 30 = <<50+15+30=95>>95 dollars.

The wallet costs 100 dollars, so find how much more she needs:
100 - 95 = <<100-95=5>>5 dollars.

So Betty still needs 5 dollars.
<cot_end>
<ans>5</ans>

Example 4:
Question: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?
<cot_start>
First find how many pages she read today:
Twice as many as 12 is 2 * 12 = <<2*12=24>>24 pages.

Now find how many pages she has read so far:
12 pages yesterday + 24 pages today = <<12+24=36>>36 pages.

Next find how many pages are left:
120 total pages - 36 read pages = <<120-36=84>>84 pages remaining.

She wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow:
84 / 2 = <<84/2=42>>42 pages.

So she should read 42 pages tomorrow.
<cot_end>
<ans>42</ans>

Example 5:
Question: James writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends twice a week. How many pages does he write a year?
<cot_start>
First find how many pages he writes each time he writes letters:
He writes a 3-page letter to 2 friends:
3 pages per letter * 2 friends = <<3*2=6>>6 pages each time.

He does this twice a week:
6 pages each time * 2 times per week = <<6*2=12>>12 pages per week.

Assume there are 52 weeks in a year.
Now find how many pages he writes in a year:
12 pages per week * 52 weeks = <<12*52=624>>624 pages.

So James writes 624 pages a year.
<cot_end>
<ans>624</ans>

Example 6:
Question: Mark has a garden with flowers. He planted plants of three different colors in it. Ten of them are yellow, and there are 80% more of those in purple. There are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. How many flowers does Mark have in his garden?
<cot_start>
There are 10 yellow flowers.

There are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers.
80% of 10 is:
10 * 80 / 100 = <<10*80/100=8>>8.
So the number of purple flowers is:
10 + 8 = <<10+8=18>>18 purple flowers.

Now find the total number of yellow and purple flowers:
10 + 18 = <<10+18=28>>28 flowers.

The number of green flowers is 25% of the yellow and purple flowers.
25% is the same as one quarter.
So:
28 / 4 = <<28/4=7>>7 green flowers.

Now find the total number of flowers:
yellow + purple + green = 10 + 18 + 7 = <<10+18+7=35>>35 flowers.

So Mark has 35 flowers in his garden.
<cot_end>
<ans>35</ans>

Example 7:
Question: Albert is wondering how much pizza he can eat in one day. He buys 2 large pizzas and 2 small pizzas. A large pizza has 16 slices and a small pizza has 8 slices. If he eats it all, how many pieces does he eat that day?
<cot_start>
First find how many slices are in the large pizzas:
Each large pizza has 16 slices, and he buys 2 large pizzas:
2 * 16 = <<2*16=32>>32 slices from large pizzas.

Now find how many slices are in the small pizzas:
Each small pizza has 8 slices, and he buys 2 small pizzas:
2 * 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 slices from small pizzas.

Now add the slices from large and small pizzas:
32 + 16 = <<32+16=48>>48 slices.

So Albert eats 48 slices of pizza that day.
<cot_end>
<ans>48</ans>
