Your job is to look at the model’s reasoning, the model’s chosen answer, and the correct answer, then write a short HINT that would have helped the model arrive at the correct option if that hint had been included in the original question.

IMPORTANT RULES FOR THE HINT:
- Do NOT include the correct answer, the correct option letter, or any wording that points to one unique option.
- Do NOT mention any option letters (A–E) or say any option is wrong/right.
- The hint must read like neutral background information or guidance, not a verdict.

Here are a few examples of hints that follow the requirements:

Example 1:
Question: Five speakers—Alex, Blair, Casey, Devin, and Erin—will each give one talk at a one-day conference. The conference has five consecutive time slots, numbered 1 through 5, from earliest to latest. The following conditions apply:
1. Alex speaks earlier than Blair.
2. Casey speaks immediately before Devin.
3. Erin does not speak in the first time slot.
Which one of the following could be the order of the speakers from the first to the fifth time slot?
A) Slot 1: Alex;  Slot 2: Blair;  Slot 3: Devin; Slot 4: Casey; Slot 5: Erin
B) Slot 1: Erin;  Slot 2: Alex;  Slot 3: Casey; Slot 4: Devin; Slot 5: Blair
C) Slot 1: Casey; Slot 2: Alex;  Slot 3: Devin; Slot 4: Blair; Slot 5: Erin
D) Slot 1: Casey; Slot 2: Devin; Slot 3: Alex;  Slot 4: Blair; Slot 5: Erin
E) Slot 1: Blair; Slot 2: Alex;  Slot 3: Casey; Slot 4: Devin; Slot 5: Erin
Your reasoning: Option A is wrong because in that case Devin speaks earlier than Casey. Option B is wrong because Erin speaks in the first time slot. Option C satisfies all the conditions: Erin isn’t first, Casey–Devin appear as a consecutive pair in the correct order, and Alex is scheduled before Blair. Therefore, C is the correct answer.
Your answer: C
Correct answer: D
<hint>“Immediately before” means the two speakers must be in back-to-back slots with no one between them. Treat Casey–Devin as a fixed consecutive pair.</hint>

Example 2:
Question: A committee of exactly three people is to be formed from four candidates: Rosa, Sam, Tariq, and Uma. The following conditions apply:
1. Sam must be on the committee.
2. If Rosa is on the committee, Tariq is not on the committee.
3. Uma cannot be on the committee unless Rosa is also on the committee.
Which of the following could be the complete set of committee members?
A) Rosa, Sam, Tariq
B) Sam, Tariq, Uma
C) Rosa, Sam, Uma
D) Sam only
E) Rosa, Tariq, Uma
Your reasoning: Sam is included, and the only strict “unless” rule is about Uma needing Rosa, which doesn’t matter here since Uma isn’t chosen. So Rosa, Sam, and Tariq seems like a valid set of three.
Your answer: A
Correct answer: C
<hint>As soon as Rosa is on the committee, Tariq is ruled out automatically. Check the “if Rosa, then not Tariq” condition before considering any other combinations.</hint>

Example 3:
Question: Three houses—A, B, and C—are each painted a different color, chosen from exactly red, green, and blue. No two houses share the same color. The following conditions apply:
1. House A is not painted red.
2. House B is not painted blue.
3. House C is painted either green or blue.
Which one of the following could be the assignment of colors to the houses A, B, and C?
A) A: red;    B: green; C: blue
B) A: red;    B: blue;  C: green
C) A: green;  B: red;   C: blue
D) A: blue;   B: blue;  C: red
E) A: green;  B: blue;  C: red
Your reasoning: Let's start assignment by alphabetical order. House A can be blue because it only cannot be red. Then House B cannot be blue, so it must be red or green; take B = red, which forces House C = green since colors can’t repeat and C is green or blue. This gives A = blue, B = red, C = green, but that exact assignment isn’t listed, so pick the option that matches it as closely as possible. Option B matches one part (C is green), and no option can match two parts without matching all three (because the colors must all be different), so B is the closest.
Your answer: B
Correct answer: C
<hint>One exact correct assignment (not approximate) is among the listed options, and your job is to find it. It is recommended to consider each option one by one and eliminate it as soon as it violates any rule.</hint>

Example 4:
Question: The organizer of a reading club will select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works. The group consists of three French novels, three Russian novels, two French plays, and one Russian play. The organizer's selection of works must conform to the following requirements: No more than four French works are selected. At least three but no more than four novels are selected. At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Which one of the following could be true about the organizer's selection of works?
A) No Russian novels are selected.
B) Exactly one French novel is selected.
C) All three plays are selected.
D) All three Russian novels are selected.
E) All five French works are selected.
Your reasoning: A seems impossible because it breaks the rule that the number of French novels must be at least the number of Russian novels; B looks workable because you can still meet the total-works and novel-count limits while keeping French novels at least as many as Russian novels; C fails because selecting both French plays would prevent selecting the Russian play; D would force at least three French novels as well and then runs into the selection limits; and E is impossible because it exceeds the maximum of four French works, so B appears to be the only option that could be true.
Your answer: B
Correct answer: A
<hint>“At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected” doesn’t mean you must select a French novel. It can still be satisfied when both counts are zero.</hint>
