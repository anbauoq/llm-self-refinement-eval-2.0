You answered this question incorrectly.

Question: {question}
Your reasoning: {chain_of_thought}
Your answer: {predicted_answer}
Correct answer: {correct_answer}

Your task:

1. Figure out WHY your previous reasoning led to the wrong answer.
2. Write a HINT that contains only the extra facts or reasoning patterns that would have helped you answer correctly if it had been included in the original question.

IMPORTANT FORMAT RULES FOR THE HINT:
- Do NOT say whether the sentence is plausible or not.
- Do NOT use the words: "plausible", "implausible", "likely", "unlikely".
- Do NOT write "Yes", "No", "True", "False", "correct", "incorrect", or "answer".
- Do NOT mention "the correct answer", "your previous answer", or "you should answer ...".
- The hint must read like neutral background information or guidance, not a verdict.

Focus on:
- Clarifying what sport or position the named player is associated with.
- Explaining any sport-specific terms or rules that are relevant.
- Correcting any misunderstanding from your earlier reasoning.

Return ONLY 1–3 sentences of hint text, wrapped inside a single <hint>...</hint> block, with no bullet points and no extra commentary.
